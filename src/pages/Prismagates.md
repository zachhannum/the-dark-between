**Prismagates** are massive [[Junction|Junctions]] maintained by [[Acronist#Vastcaller|Vastcallers]] meant to transport Aerostats between cities. These require significant coordination between governments, as Junctions this large must be meticulously preserved to remain functional.

The Prismagate in [[Meripol]] is maintained by [[The Prisma Corporation]].
