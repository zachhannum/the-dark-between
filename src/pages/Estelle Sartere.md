title: Estelle Sartere

**Estelle Sartere** is a member of the [[Vigil]] in [[Meripol]] investigating the [[Acronist|Acronists]] that have been going missing.

She has a niece, [[Valent Childs]], who is a scion of the [[Primal Spirit of Soul]]. Valent's manifestations of Soul were becoming dangerous as she got older, so Estelle went to the [[Saetorim Institute]] at a time when [[Sulazar Stillwater|Sulazar]] still worked there, and asked them for help.

Now, Valent has gone missing along with many other [[Acronist|Acronists]] in [[Meripol]]. Estelle has mounted an investigation, using the full might of the [[Vigil]] behind her to bring Valent back and bring justice to whomever is kidnapping people.
