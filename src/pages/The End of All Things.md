The **End of All Things** is the prophesied end of the Universe and the [[Dominion]] by the [[Hyrac|Hyracian Civilization]] after coming to [[Gris]]. They wrote the [[Lacunographies]], which describes how [[The Dread]] will bring about the **End of All Things**.

The [[Lightless Eye]], a cult operating out of [[Gris]], formed out of worship of this prophesy and [[Altrement|The Dark Between]].

What is not largely understood is that **The End of All Things** is not of the future, but of the past. That it has already come to be fulfilled. [[The Dread]] were formed *from* the [[Dominion]] fighting against the entropic death of the universe with their creation of the [[Worldsphere|Worldspheres]]. They are the embodiment of the Dominion's fight against the very nature of reality and the Universe.
