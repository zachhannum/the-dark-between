# Luminous Magic

Luminous Magic is Magic that is created or performed through [[The Luminary]]. This feat is accomplished through the [[Thread]]. Utilizing the direct connection with the Luminary allows one to bend reality to their will through a [[Conviction]]. Creating anything meaningful with Luminous Magic is no small feat, and although all living creatures on [[Naos]] have a Thread, few can utilize it to distort the fabric of reality to their will. Wielders of Luminous Magic are called [[Acronist|Acronists]].

## Permanent Magic
It is possible for [[Conviction|Convictions]] to become [[Fixed Truth|Fixed Truths]] if the manifestation is strong enough. [[Luminous Magic#Runes|Runes]] can help retain the efficacy of Fixed Truths, though almost all Fixed Truths degrade over time unless regularly maintained or are upheld by a [[Collective Conviction]]. 

## Training
For most denizens of [[Naos]], Luminous Magic requires years of training to form a strong enough [[Conviction]] to manifest any one of the Aspects, usually with the aid of a [[Primal Spirits|Primal Spirit]]. 

## The Law of Diametric Truth
When manifesting [[Conviction|Convictions]], it is the Acronist's *belief*, or *will*, that convinces the Luminary that reality behaves in a certain way. The greater the discripancy between the Acronist's Conviction and the [[Cornerstone]], the greater the potential [[Backlash]].

## Runes
Some cultures on [[Naos]] believe that certain symbols or runes are tied to the different aspects of Primal Spirits and Luminous Magic. The reality is that while these symbols don't intrisincally have any power over certain aspects, it has been found that using runes can aid in the strength of the Conviction formed while casting luminous magic. Runes can also provide a convenient way for Acronists to read and understand certain Fixed Truths that have been laid upon a particular place or item, so are usedemdash as a form of common communication.

## The Primal Spirits
While a particularly talented and rare [[Acronist]] may be able to manifest [[Conviction|Convictions]] with a direct link to [[The Luminary]], *most* do so with the aid of a [[Primal Spirits|Primal Spirit]]. Not only do Primal Spirits allow an Acronist to manifest Convictions of greater magnitude, they also rebuff potential [[Backlash]].

## Approaches
[[Conviction|Convictions]] are manifested using different approaches depending on the desired end result.

### 3rd Heirarch | Kyros

## Loss of Magic

Individuals who have had their [[Thread]] severed are called [[The Faded|Fades]], and can no longer manifest Luminous Magic or be directly affected by it.
