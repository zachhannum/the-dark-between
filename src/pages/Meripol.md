---

Meripol is the largest city in [[Aljiuedum]], as well as its capitol. The city is built onto a series of plateau’s along the southern coast of Aljiuedum, each of the city’s districts being housed on a different shelf. Inside the canyons between the plateau’s there are a number of villages and towns. There is also an elevator on the southern plateau that leads to a [[Deep Dwellers|Msanti]] outpost attached to Meripol, a sort of trading center, embassy, and welcome center for relations between the overlanders and the Msanti.
