title: Meripol
---

Meripol is the largest city in [[Aljieudum]], as well as its capitol. The city is built onto a series of plateaus along the southern coast of Aljieudum, each of the city’s districts being housed on a different shelf. Inside the canyons between the plateau’s there are a number of villages and towns. There is also an elevator on the southern plateau that leads to a [[Deep Dwellers|Msanti]] outpost attached to Meripol, a sort of trading center, embassy, and welcome center for relations between the overlanders and the Msanti.

## Economy

Meripol is a thriving economic hub in the country of [[Aljieudum]], with a diverse range of industries driving its prosperity. The city's strategic location on the southern coast of the kingdom has long made it a hub for trade and commerce, with merchant ships docking in its bustling port to unload their goods and take on new cargo.

One of the city's main industries is fishing, with the waters off the southern coast being home to a rich array of sea life. Meripol's fish markets are known throughout Aljiuedum for their fresh, high-quality catches, and the city's seafood restaurants are a popular destination for tourists and locals alike.

In addition to its maritime industries, Meripol is also home to a number of artisans and craftsmen who produce a variety of goods, from pottery and jewelry to furniture and clothing. The city's many markets and shopping districts are a treasure trove of unique, locally-made products, and its artisanal traditions are an important part of its cultural identity.

Another major contributor to the city's economy is tourism, with Meripol's beautiful coastal setting and rich cultural heritage attracting visitors from all over the kingdom and beyond. The city's many hotels, inns, and bed and breakfasts are always busy, and its many attractions, such as its historic landmarks, museums, and cultural festivals, such as ones celebrating [[Illuminaris]], draw large crowds of tourists.

Being the location of [[The Basentia Omnia]], Meripol also thrives with its constant influx of [[Acronist|Acronists]] graduating from the university and entering various industries, such as travel ([[Grav-rail]], Aerostats, [[Prismagates]]), Energy ([[Acronist#Furybearers|Furybearers]] powering the cities electrical systems), and more.

Finally, the Msanti outpost located on the southern plateau plays a significant role in the city's economy, serving as a hub for trade and diplomacy between the overlanders and the [[Deep Dwellers|Msanti]]. The outpost is home to a number of merchants who specialize in the unique goods produced by the Msanti, such as their advanced technological devices, and it serves as a gateway for cultural exchange between the two groups.

Overall, the economy of Meripol is diverse and dynamic, with a wide range of industries contributing to its prosperity and growth.
