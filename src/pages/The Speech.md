Hey everyone, if you don't know me my name is Zach. I met Jake, oh, almost 24 years ago, and we've been like brothers ever since.

Jake and I grew up together, so I speak on good authority when I tell you that he's come a *long* way. As his older brother, it's pretty hard for me not to stand up here and tell the most embarrassing stories I can think of, but I had to remind myself that this isn't a roast, so, Jake, I'll spare you the worst of it.

When we were kids, as the eldest I had the privilege (at least that's what my parents called it) of mowing the lawn. We had one of those sitting mowers, and for a little kid it had quite a lot of pick-up, so you had to be careful. Jake, as younger brothers often do, became jealous. But I like to think I was a good brother, so of course I, without telling our mom or dad, let him take a spin at the wheel. It took all of sixty seconds for us to careen straight into the air conditioning unit, leaving a massive dent in the side of the lawn mower. That day, a brotherly pact was formed, and so we told no-one of our misdeeds. It took a few days, but eventually the results of our joyride were discovered by our parents. To be completely honest, I don't even remember what our punishment was. But we had each other's backs. And that's what being a good brother is all about, after all.

Now, as my brother takes his next step in life, I can't help but feel proud of who he has become. He has always been likable, outgoing, and relatively good-looking. But with Morgan by his side, I know that he has grown into an even better man. 

For those of you who don't know, Morgan volunteers to train dogs for --INSERT HERE--. That's such an incredible thing to do, which I'm sure takes a great deal of patience and compassion. When I learned that about her, it told me everything I needed to know about her character and what Jake saw in her. Little did *she* know that her greatest challenge would be training her future husband. Seriously though, I know Morgan has taught Jake so much about love, commitment, loyalty... how to sit, stay, roll over...

And I know that Jake has taught Morgan so much as well, like how to eat an entire Domino's pizza in one sitting and make it down the ski slope in one piece. In all seriousness, I know that Jake has taught Morgan what it means to have a partner who will always be there and love unconditionally. And I have no doubt that Morgan has done the same for Jake.

As your older brother, I feel it is also my responsibility to try and impart some wisdom on you. And Morgan, since you'll now be my younger sister-in-law, this advice applies to you too:

As the two of you embark on this new journey together, there will be highs and lows---ebbs and flows. But no matter what comes your way, always remember to never stop learning new things, never stop exploring new places, and never stop trying new things. And now that you're together, you can grow together. You can support each other's dreams, push each other out of your comfort zones, and be there for each other every step of the way.

So raise a glass to Jake and Morgan---I can't wait to see what the future holds for you both. Congrats!
