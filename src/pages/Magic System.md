Developing a new magic system. This magic system will be leaning towards hard magic so that it can be used in an RPG and inspired by the idea that all magic comes from the carcass of a dead god. This is highly inspired by the concept of a "whalefall" in nature where an entire ecosystem is created around a dead whale carcass. In this case, titan carcasses create an entire magical ecosystem. The story will take place in a grim-dark post-apocalyptic epic fantasy world. A titanic war of the gods left the planet devastated, and the denizens of this world survive in the wasteland left behind. Various titan carcasses remain, scattered across the landscape, which can be harvested for sources of magical power.

The magic system in this world revolves around the concept that the remaining magical energy in the world is derived from the dead gods' carcasses. These titanic remnants act as conduits for different types of magic, each possessing its own unique properties and abilities.

Instead of drawing power from traditional elements like fire, water, or earth, characters in this RPG can tap into various aspects of the dead gods' essence.

The type of essence depends both on the type of titan that the essence is harvested from and the location of the body of the titan from which the essence came from.

For example, if a character harvests essence from a titan that was a god of strength and power, they would gain access to abilities related to enhanced physical strength and durability. If the titan was a god of knowledge and wisdom, the essence would grant the character enhanced intelligence and the ability to tap into vast amounts of information.

To tap into these essences, characters must first locate a titan carcass. These carcasses can range in size from small fragments to colossal remains that span miles. Once a titan is found, characters can use specialized tools or magical rituals to extract the essence within.

Extracting essence is not without risks. The process is physically and mentally demanding, often taking a toll on the character's health. Additionally, the extraction process can attract dangerous creatures or even other factions who also seek these valuable resources.

Once an essence is obtained, characters can manipulate it to create various magical effects. This includes offensive spells, defensive barriers, healing abilities, or even temporary enhancements to their physical abilities.

However, there are limitations to this magic system. Characters can only harness one type of essence at a time and must rely on their own creativity and ingenuity to combine different aspects of the essence for unique effects.

Additionally, using too much essence at once can have detrimental effects on the user's body and mind. Overuse can lead to physical deformities or mental instability. Characters must carefully manage their usage of magic and find ways to replenish their essence reserves through exploring new areas or engaging in specific quests.

Depending on what part of the body the essence was harvested from, characters may gain unique abilities or attributes. For example, extracting essence from a titan of strength's eyes might grant the character enhanced vision or the ability to see in the dark. Extracting essence from a titan of death's heart might grant the character the ability to manipulate life force or communicate with spirits.

The essence itself takes the physical form of fossilized remnants of the dead titan, glowing with a faint, ethereal light. These crystals can be stored in specially designed containers and used as a source of power for magical spells and abilities.

Individuals that make a living harvesting from titan corpses are called Reapers. It is an extremely dangerous job, the area surrounding titan corpses is typically very dangerous for humans due to the ecosystem that is created around the corpse, with various maleffects, dangerous magical predators attracted by the resource-rich titan body, etc. 

The extraction process typically involves specialized equipment in the form of tools and machinery designed specifically for extracting essence from titan carcasses. These tools can vary depending on the size and condition of the titan, but they generally include things like excavation drills, magical siphoning devices, and containment chambers.

Reapers must be highly skilled in navigating and surviving in the treacherous environments surrounding these titan carcasses. They need to be adept at tracking, combat, and have a deep understanding of the magical properties of different titans to safely harvest essence.

Once extracted, the essence must be carefully stored and preserved to maintain its potency. Specially designed containers made from rare materials that can contain the essence's powerful energy are used for this purpose. These containers are often intricately crafted and enchanted to prevent leakage or degradation of the essence over time.

The collected essence is highly sought after by various factions in this post-apocalyptic world. It is used not only for personal power but also as a valuable resource for trade and warfare. Some factions may hoard essences for their own purposes or seek out specific types of essences to gain an advantage over their rivals.

The utilization of titan essence has far-reaching consequences beyond just personal power. It affects societal structures, politics, economy, and even ethics. The scarcity or abundance of certain types of essences can shape society's power dynamics and drive conflicts between different groups.

## Cypher System

This rpg will use the Cypher System from Monte Cook games a base for the rules.

The Cypher System is a versatile role-playing game system that focuses on narrative storytelling and streamlined rules. It emphasizes player agency and creativity, allowing for a wide range of character options and storytelling possibilities.

In the context of this magic system, the Cypher System can be easily adapted to incorporate the unique mechanics and limitations of harnessing titan essence. The system's flexibility allows players to create characters with diverse abilities, backgrounds, and motivations within this post-apocalyptic world.

The core mechanics of the Cypher System revolve around the use of "cyphers," which are one-use magical items or abilities that characters can find or create. These cyphers can represent the essence extracted from titan carcasses, allowing players to access powerful magical effects.

The essence crystals obtained from titan carcasses can function as cyphers in the game. Each crystal represents a specific type of essence harvested from a particular titan, granting unique abilities or attributes when used. Players can discover or trade for different crystals to expand their repertoire of magical powers.

Players can also customize their characters' abilities by choosing appropriate descriptors, foci, and talents from the Cypher System rules. Descriptors represent a character's innate traits or background, while foci represent their specialized skills or areas of expertise. Talents further enhance these abilities, allowing for more unique and powerful effects.

The extraction process itself can be represented through skill checks or specialized actions within the Cypher System rules. Characters with high crafting skills or knowledge in magical arts may have an advantage in obtaining more potent essence crystals during extraction.

To manage the usage and potential drawbacks of using too much essence, players could utilize a resource management system similar to other aspects of the Cypher System. Each player's character could have an "essence reserve" that represents their current supply of extracted essence. The use of spells or abilities would consume a portion of this reserve, which would need to be replenished over time.

The magic system can also incorporate rules for different types of titans and their corresponding essence properties. For example, certain titans may be more abundant in specific regions or have distinct physical characteristics that affect the extraction process or the resulting essence's potency.

The Cypher System's mechanics for exploration, combat, and social interactions can also be utilized to enhance gameplay in this post-apocalyptic world. Players can navigate treacherous environments, engage in intense battles with magical predators or rival factions, and negotiate alliances or trade deals with various factions vying for control over titan essence.

Overall, combining the Cypher System's user-friendly mechanics with the unique elements of this magic system derived from titan carcasses can create a rich and immersive tabletop RPG experience. Players have the opportunity to explore a grim-dark post-apocalyptic world, harness powerful magical abilities, navigate complex faction dynamics, and uncover the mysteries behind the remnants of dead gods.
