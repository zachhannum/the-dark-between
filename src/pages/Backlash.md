# Backlash
**Backlash** occurs when a [[Conviction]] is made false by the [[The Luminary]], allowing reality to return to the [[Cornerstone]]. In most cases, Backlash is all but undetectable. However, in more significant [[Conviction|Convictions]], Backlash can manifest as both internal and external harm to the [[Acronist]] attempting to manifest.
