Lotus is a drug developed by [[Vera Lauten]] and [[Enzo Quint]], although their original formula did not take the decorative form of a flower and had a different name, and was used for scientific research. 

## Development
Lotus was developed in its initial form by studying [[Threadwalkers]], as well as the runes inlaid on the [[Spirit Sanctum]] in [[Mehnateruna]] created by [[The Church of Aphothis]] which aided in the sacrifice of [[Thread|Threads]]. 

## Effects
Using their research as inspiration, Enzo and Vera created a liquid formula that could bring the Thread further into the physical realm, which is how Threadwalkers are partially able to operateâ€”they tug on threads like harp strings, pulling them *partially* into the physical realm in order to travel to them.

By bringing Threads into the Physical Realm gives them more potency when they are severed via a [[Bifurcator]], creating a much larger [[Liminal Bubble]].

In addition to the above effects, Lotus also gives the user an out-of-body experience, typically warping time around them and experiencing another plane of existence entirely.

## As a Street Drug
Vera turned the formula over to [[The Sonxai]] for larger scale production for her final plan, and the organization decided to release it onto the street without her permission. Sonxai converted the formula to a more appealing ingestible white flower.
