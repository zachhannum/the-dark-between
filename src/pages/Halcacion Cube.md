title: The Halcacion Cube
---

## Template

The Halcacion Cube contains the remains of a space station belonging to a long-dead alien civilization. The cube itself resembles a menger cube, created by The Spiral, one of the Dread, chaos gods from the Dark Between. The space station has been turned in to a fractal maze, each corridor and room potentially leading into a deeper copy. The station is also hunted by Wedge Fiends, devious creatures that hunt the space between worlds and enter the physical realm through right corners. Can you give me a  description (300-400 words) of a room in this station that is XXX. The perspective is second person POV, from characters in a steampunk fantasy world that have no knowledge of alien technology, so leave out any verbiage about aliens. Keep the text to just descriptive imagery.

## The notes of [[Meyna Neyaruna]]

The Halcacion Cube contains the remains of a space station belonging to a long-dead alien civilization. The cube itself resembles a menger cube, created by The Spiral, one of the Dread, chaos gods from the Dark Between. The space station has been turned in to a fractal maze, each corridor and room potentially leading into a deeper copy. The station is also hunted by Wedge Fiends, devious creatures that hunt the space between worlds and enter the physical realm through right corners. Can you give me a series of notes or diary entries that a character who became trapped in this place may have written over the course of several weeks as they attempted to navigate this place. Each note should be about 200 words. The perspective is from a character named Meyna Neyaruna from a steampunk fantasy world that have no knowledge of alien technology. Avoid cliches. They should show her slow descent into madness as the wedge fiends stalk and hunt her. She comes up with the name Wedge Fiend, she does not know what they are really called. She doesn't know how she came to this place, but eventually she starts to figure out the fractal nature of the cube. Still, it does not help her escape. Eventually, she writes a final note talking about who she is.

Note 1:
I don't know where I am. I'm in a strange place, surrounded by metal walls and twisted corridors that seem to go on forever. I can hear strange noises in the distance, like something is moving around out there. Whatever it is, it doesn't sound friendly.

Note 2:
I've been wandering around this place for what feels like days, but I still haven't found a way out. The corridors keep repeating themselves, like some kind of twisted maze. And those noises...they're getting louder. It's like something is following me, stalking me through the shadows.

Note 3:
The same room. Again. I think I'm losing my mind. I saw one of them today. A creature unlike anything I've ever seen before. It was small and quick, with razor-sharp claws and glowing eyes that seemed to follow me wherever I went. I call them Wedge Fiends because they seemed to slip through the corners of the walls like magic.

Note 4:
I think they're hunting me now. Every time I turn a corner, there's another one waiting for me. They seem to be getting smarter too...ambushing me from behind or blocking off my escape routes. I don't know how much longer I can keep running.

Note 5:
I've started to notice something strange about this place - it's not just a maze, it's a fractal maze. Every corridor and room seems to be a copy of itself on a smaller or larger scale. It's like some kind of alien architecture that defies all logic and reason.

Note 6:
The Wedge Fiends are closing in on me now. There's no escape - every path leads back to where I started or deeper into this endless labyrinth of metal and madness. My only hope is to find some kind of weapon or tool that can help me fight back against these creatures.

Final Note:
My name is Meyna Neyaruna, captain of the airship Waverider. If anyone finds this note...know that I fought until the very end against the horrors of this place. May my spirit soar free once more among the clouds...

> You find skeletal remains huddled in a corner of the room, curled up as if they were trying to protect themselves from something. Their bones are brittle and yellowed, covered in dust and cobwebs. Their clothes are torn and shredded, revealing scraps of flesh still clinging to their bones. The expression on the skull is one of fear and desperation, with empty eye sockets staring out at nothing. It's clear that they died a long time ago, alone and forgotten. You find a note clutched in their bony hand, the ink faded and barely legible.


## Wedge Fiends

> Something in this room causes your hair to stand on end. As you investigate further, you catch a glimpse of movement out of the corner of your eye, something shadow in one of the bare corners of the room.

> Turning towards it, you see a flicker of darkness dart across the room. It's quick and elusive, almost like a shadow that moves on its own accord. You try to focus on it, but it's too fast to see clearly.


## 1 - Mech-Bay

> As you step into the room, you're greeted by the sight of massive machines suspended from chains. They look like they could crush you with a single misstep. The shadows they cast seem to writhe and twist, almost as if they're alive. You hear the occasional drip of oil hitting metal and the clanging of tools being moved around on workbenches. It's all so foreign to you - this technology is unlike anything you've ever seen before. But despite your unfamiliarity with it, there's an undeniable sense of awe that fills you as you take in the sheer scale of it all.


## 2 Pressure Regulators

> As you step into this room, you are immediately struck by the overwhelming smell of dampness and decay. The air is humid and thick, and there is a constant dripping sound that echoes through the pipes. The room is small and cramped, with pipes running along every wall and ceiling.
> 
> The pipes are made of a strange, metallic material that glows with a dull blue light, and they crisscross the room in a seemingly random pattern. Some of the pipes are thick and wide, while others are thin and twisted. There are valves, gauges, and other strange mechanical devices attached to the pipes, and the walls are covered in graffiti and strange symbols.
> 
> The room is filled with various tools and spare parts, scattered haphazardly on the floor and on the shelves. There are wrenches, pliers, and screwdrivers of all shapes and sizes, as well as boxes of bolts, nuts, and washers.


## 3 - Small Galley


> The walls of this room are made of a sleek, metallic material that glistens in the dim light. Rows of cabinets line the walls, each one containing what appears to be empty food dispensers. You can't help but wonder what kind of food the denizens who once inhabited this space station consumed.
> 
> In the center of the room, there is a small, rectangular table made out of a smooth material that you have never seen before. It is surrounded by four chairs.. You approach the table and run your hand over its surface, feeling a strange energy emanating from it.

> You hear an odd sound coming from one of the cabinets. 

> You cautiously approach it and find that it is dripping oil onto the metal floor below. The sound echoes through the room.


## 4 - Bunk Room

> As you step into this next room, your boots crunch on the debris littering the floor. The room is small and cramped, with bunk beds lining the walls. The metal frames of the beds are rusted and warped, and the mattresses are torn and stained.

> The air is thick with a musty smell, like old sweat and mildew. You can see messy sheets dangling off the beds, some of them partially covering empty spaces where other mattresses used to be. The blankets are bunched up in disarray, as if their owners had left in a hurry.

> The walls are made of a strange material that you've never seen before. It's smooth and shiny, like polished obsidian, but it has a strange iridescence to it that makes it seem almost alive. You can see faint patterns etched into its surface, like circuitry or glyphs.

> As you move further into the room, your eyes adjust to the dim light filtering in through cracks in the walls. You notice strange objects scattered throughout the bunkroom - odd devices that look like they belong in a laboratory rather than a sleeping area.

>There's a large console on one wall that seems to be connected to some kind of power source. Wires and cables snake out from its base and disappear into holes in the wall. You have no idea what any of it does.


## 5 - Vet's Office

> You step cautiously into the room, your eyes scanning the unfamiliar surroundings. A musty smell lingers in the air, mixed with a faint hint of animal musk. The walls are lined with empty kennels, each one stacked haphazardly against each other. You can't help but feel a sense of unease as you realize that this room was once used to house creatures you know nothing about.

> Your gaze is drawn towards the center of the room where a large stainless-steel table dominates the space. It's not like any table you've seen before, its surface smooth and shiny like glass. You can't help but wonder what kind of creatures were once examined on this table.

> As you move closer, your eyes wander to the cabinets lining the walls. They're filled with strange objects that you can't quite decipher. Gauze and bandages are neatly stacked next to animal treats and analgesic creams - a bizarre combination that only adds to your confusion.


## 6 - Server Farm

> You step into a room that hums with a steady, mechanical sound. The air is cool and crisp, carrying the scent of metal and ozone. Before you are rows upon rows of towering machines, each one identical to the next. They stretch as far as the eye can see, vanishing into the distance like an endless forest of steel.

> The machines themselves are contained within glass cages, their blinking red lights casting an eerie glow across the room. You can see their components whirring and spinning behind the transparent panes, like clockwork gears in a grand mechanism.

> Overhead, cables snake between the machines like vines in a jungle canopy. They are neatly tied and bundled together, though here and there you spot frayed or severed ends where they have been cut or damaged.

> Despite your unfamiliarity with this advanced technology, you can sense that these machines are important - essential even - to the functioning of this place. They seem to be working tirelessly, performing some unknown task with relentless efficiency.


## 7 - Surgery Room

> As you step into the room, your eyes are immediately drawn to the large surgical theater in the center. The room is expansive, with elevated observation booths lining the walls, each filled with an array of strange equipment and devices. The lighting is harsh and sterile, casting a cold glow over everything.
> 
> Your gaze falls upon the surgical table in the center of the theater. It is large and imposing, made of gleaming stainless steel. Upon it lies a creature unlike anything you have ever seen before. It resembles a humanoid figure, but with an eerie ant-like shell carapace covering its body.
> 
> The sight that meets your eyes is horrifying. The creature has been brutally bisected by some unknown force. Its insides spill out onto the table in a grotesque display of gore and viscera. Blood stains everything - the table, the floor, even the walls.
> 
> Surgical tools lay scattered around the table, their blades caked in blood and gore. They look like something out of a nightmare - sharp and gleaming in the harsh light.
> 
> Despite all this horror, your attention is drawn back to the elevated observation booths that line the walls. Each one contains strange equipment that you cannot begin to understand - glowing orbs, pulsing crystals, and intricate machinery that hums with power.

## 8 - Waiting Room

> You step into the waiting room, the scent of sanitizer filling your nostrils. The room is dimly lit, with rows of seats occupying the center, some of them tipped over haphazardly. The upholstery on the chairs is a dull grey, threadbare at places and stained with unknown substances. 
> 
> A small table stands in one corner, stacked high with magazines and brochures. You pick up a glossy pamphlet, but it's written in an unknown language filled with strange symbols and diagrams that make no sense to you.
> 
> On closer inspection, you notice an empty coffee pot sitting beside the pamphlets. The pot is made of a material that you've never seen before; it's smooth and metallic to the touch. You wonder how it works, but there are no buttons or levers to be found.
> 
> The walls of the room are covered in strange patterns that shift and change like a living thing. It's as if they're made up of countless smaller tiles that move independently of one another, creating an ever-shifting mosaic.
> 
> You turn to leave, but as you do so, you catch sight of something out of the corner of your eye. It's a small creature with sharp claws and glittering eyes standing at the far corner of the room. It disappears into the crease between the two walls before you can get a good look at it.

## 9 - Station Exchange

> As you step into a wide open room, you are met with an overwhelming sight. Shelves and walls are piled high with all manner of goods and trinkets, their vibrant colors standing out against the dull metal of the room. A tower of boxes, each emblazoned with bright logos and pictures, reaches almost to the ceiling.
> 
> On one wall, you see a row of strange devices. Their screens flicker with bright colors and flashing symbols.
> 
> In the center of the room sits a large cooler, its lid slightly ajar. Inside, you find an array of drinks in every shape and size, in strange containers that defy description.
> 
> As you explore further, you notice a small shelf tucked away in a corner. It holds a collection of what looks like souvenirs - tiny cylindrical models with intricate etchings and black fins, almost fish-like in appearance, and strange creatures made from some sort of shiny material. They catch the light in mesmerizing ways as you pick them up and turn them over in your hands.

## 10 - Conference Room

> The air is cold and musty in this next room, and the faint sound of static fills your ears. Your eyes adjust to the dim lighting, revealing a long table that dominates the center of the room.
> 
> The chairs around the table are large and imposing, with high backs that curve inwards like claws. They're overturned and scattered haphazardly around the room, as though the occupants had fled in a hurry.
> 
> A stack of folders and papers lies scattered on one end of the table, their contents spilled out for all to see. They're filled with strange symbols and diagrams, written in a language you don't recognize.
> 
> As you approach the table, you notice subtle differences in each copy of it stretching out to infinity. The lines become more intricate and detailed as they repeat themselves over and over again.


## 11 - Greenhouse

> As you step into a vast room, the first thing that hits you is the intense humidity. It's like walking into a sauna, and your skin immediately begins to glisten with sweat. The air is thick and heavy, and the scent of earthy plant life fills your nostrils.
> 
> The room is filled with hydroponic chambers and soil-bed trees, each one bursting with greenery. The plants are overgrown and unattended, their leaves spilling out over the sides of their containers. They crowd against the walls and ceiling, pushing into walking paths.
> 
> You can see a variety of different plant species here - some tall and spindly, others short and squat. Some have leaves that are broad and flat, while others are thin and needle-like. All of them seem to be thriving in this environment, despite the lack of human care.
> 
> You notice that several of the trees have grown together, their trunks twisted around one another in a tangled mass. It's as if they're trying to reach towards something in the center of the room - something you can't quite see from where you're standing.
> 
> As you move deeper into the greenhouse, your eyes are drawn to a massive vine that has wound its way up one wall. Its leaves are glossy and dark green, and its tendrils curl around anything they come into contact with.

## 12 - Traffic Control

> You step into a hexagonal room, filled with an array of strange devices and blinking lights. The air is thick with the hum of machinery and the scent of ozone. The walls are lined with rows of screens, each displaying a chaotic flurry of data that you can barely make sense of.
> 
> In the center of the room stands a massive console, covered in switches and knobs that seem to stretch on forever. Above the console is a floating array of interconnected pinpricks of light, like stars in the sky. They hover there, and every few seconds a pulse of light flows from one to another.


## 13 - Command Center

> You step into a wide, circular room, with an amphitheater-style arrangement of blank screens and control consoles forming a ring around a central platform. The consoles are sleek and smooth, their surfaces devoid of any visible buttons or switches. Instead, they seem to respond to touch, their surfaces glowing faintly as you approach them.
> 
> The air in the room is cool and still, with a faint hum emanating from the consoles. You can almost feel the power coursing through them, like a living thing waiting to be awakened. As you approach one of the screens, your fingers hover over its surface. Without warning, it springs to life beneath your touch.
> 
> Images begin to flicker across the screen - strange symbols and patterns that seem to shift and change before your eyes. You watch in amazement as lines of text appear on another screen nearby, forming words that are completely unfamiliar to you.

## 14 - Life Support

> As you step into the room, you immediately notice a steady, low-pitched hum coming from the walls. The air is cool and refreshing. The walls are lined with large, intricate machines that pulse with a soft blue light. Long, metallic tubes run along the ceiling and walls, feeding into the machines.
> 
> In the center of the room, there is a large circular structure that appears to be a giant tank filled with a transparent liquid.
> 
> The room is filled with various consoles, screens, and panels, displaying all sorts of information.

## 15 - Communications Hall

> As you enter the room, you are struck by the eerie silence and the faint hum of electricity in the air. The walls are made of a smooth, metallic material that reflects the dim light of the room. In the center of the room, there is a large circular structure that looks like a giant spider web made of thin, shining wires. The web extends from the floor to the ceiling and is surrounded by blinking lights of different colors.
> 
> On the walls, there are strange symbols and diagrams that seem to be etched onto the metal.
> 
> In the corner of the room, there is a console with buttons, switches, and screens displaying various graphs and numbers. 
> 
> Every few seconds a static hum can be heard from the center of the room, followed by a series of beeps and clicks from the console.

## 16 - Laundromat

> As you step into the room, you are greeted by a cacophony of sounds: hissing, bubbling, and churning noises mix with a high-pitched whine. The room is filled with large, metallic drums, each the size of a small car. The drums are arranged in rows, with narrow aisles in between, and they are all spinning at different speeds, creating a mesmerizing visual display.
> 
> The walls are covered in shimmering tiles that change color and pattern every few seconds.
> 
> The drums are filled with strange, multi-colored liquids, and the clothes that are inside them are spinning and tumbling, being washed and dried at the same time. Some of the drums emit a bright light that seems to be scanning the clothes, while others emit a strange, pulsating sound.

## 17 - Biology Lab

> As you cautiously enter the next room, the first thing that catches your attention is the metallic box in the center of the room. It's been tipped over, and its glass doors have been shattered. Inside it, there are various petri dishes filled with cultures of bacteria. However, something seems off about them. The bacteria have grown beyond their designated areas and have spread across the cooler's shelves.
> 
> The lab itself is dimly lit, but a Bunsen burner flickers with a single blue flame in one corner. You can hear the steady hum of machinery in the background, and it's clear that this room was once a place of scientific study and experimentation.
> 
> The air is musty and stale, and you can almost taste the scent of decay as you step closer to the cooler. The bacteria cultures inside are diverse and colorful, ranging from bright green to deep reds and purples. It's almost mesmerizing to look at them as they pulse and move slowly within their dishes.
> 
> Despite the apparent lack of maintenance in this room, everything seems to be in order – or at least as much as it can be considering the situation. You can't help but wonder about what kind of experiments were conducted here, what kind of research was being done on these samples.


## 18 - Medical Bay

> This room is littered with strange equipment and supplies, some of which appear to have been smashed or broken beyond repair. The walls and floor are slick with a strange, viscous substance that seems to have dripped from the ceiling.
> 
> The room is dominated by a large, central console, surrounded by smaller terminals and monitors. Some of these screens flicker to life as you approach, displaying complex diagrams and readouts that are completely incomprehensible to you.
> 
> Around the edges of the room, shelves and cabinets are stacked with rows upon rows of containers and vials. Some of these are familiar enough - bandages, syringes, scalpels - but most are completely unrecognizable. Strange liquids bubble and froth in beakers and test tubes. Tiny instruments glint in the dim light.
> 
> As you move cautiously through the room, trying to avoid stepping on any of the debris scattered across the floor, your eyes are drawn to a large metal table in one corner. Strapped to this table is a strange device that resembles nothing so much as an enormous insect carapace. Tubes and wires snake out from its sides into various ports on the walls.
> 
> You can't help but feel a creeping sense of unease as you look around this room. It's clear that whatever was being treated here was not human - or even remotely similar to anything you've ever encountered before.

## 19 - Engineering

> You step into the next room, and your eyes are immediately drawn to the center of the space. A large, metallic structure looms before you, pulsing with a faint, blue light. The heart of the station, it seems to be struggling to keep the entire place half-alive.
> 
> You can feel a sense of unease creeping up on you as you notice the intricate patterns etched into its surface. They seem almost organic, like veins running through an otherworldly creature.
> 
> As you approach cautiously, you notice a soft hum emanating from within. It's almost soothing in its own way, but there's an underlying sense of danger that keeps you on edge.
> 
> Suddenly, there's a loud hiss and a burst of steam as something shifts deep within the metallic structure.
> 
> All around you are pipes and wires snaking their way across the walls and floor. Some are glowing with an eerie green light, while others seem to be corroded and leaking some sort of black liquid.
> 
> The air is thick with the stench of burnt metal and ozone. You can feel your skin prickling with static electricity as you take another cautious step forward.
> 
> You notice a faint flicker in one of the pipes nearby, and suddenly there's a bright flash of light that illuminates the entire room. For a split second, everything is bathed in blinding white before fading back to darkness.

## 20 - Observation Deck

> You step through the threshold the next room and your breath catches in your throat. The room is expansive, with walls made entirely of glass that stretch impossibly high and wide, giving you an unobstructed view of an infinite expanse of the night sky.
> 
> Stars twinkle like diamonds against a velvety black backdrop, their light casting a soft glow over the room. You can see swirling patterns in distant corners, glowing with vibrant hues, and clusters of stars glimmering like jewels.
> 
> You walk closer to the edge, drawn by the sheer beauty of it all. The floor beneath your feet is made from an unfamiliar material that shimmers like liquid silver. 
> 
> You reach out to touch it and feel a slight tingle on your fingers.
> 
> As you turn to leave, a shadow passes over your face, only for a moment.

## 21 - Kitchen

> You enter what appears to be a kitchen, your eyes immediately drawn to the gleaming stainless steel counters and cabinets that line the walls. The industrial feel of the space is accentuated by the sharp knives scattered haphazardly on every available surface, glinting in the dim light. 
> 
> As you move deeper into the room, you notice several large coolers that have long since broken down, their contents now rotten and putrid. The stench assaults your nostrils, causing you to gag slightly. You can only imagine what kind of food might have been stored in those coolers before they ceased to function.


## 22 - Digital Library


> You step through the doorway into a room filled with towering columns of shimmering light. The walls are lined with glowing screens, each displaying an endless stream of symbols and letters that you cannot comprehend. The air hums with a low electronic buzz, and the space is suffused with a cool blue light that seems to emanate from every surface.
> 
> In the center of the room stands a massive crystal structure, its facets reflecting the endless streams of data that flow around it. Inside the crystal, you can see strange patterns of light dancing and shifting, as if alive.


> As you approach the crystal, you notice that there are terminals dotting its surface - each one pulsing with energy. 


> You reach out hesitantly and touch one, and suddenly a flood of information floods your mind - images, sounds, text - all flashing by in an instant.
> 
> You step back in shock, but then curiosity gets the better of you. You tentatively touch another terminal, and this time you focus your mind on trying to make sense of what's happening. Slowly but surely, you begin to pick up bits and pieces of knowledge - histories of long-dead civilizations, mathematical equations beyond your wildest imaginings.


## 23 - Meditation Chamber

> As you enter the room, you are immediately struck by the calm atmosphere. The walls are made of a smooth, gray material that seems to emanate a soft glow, casting a soothing light on everything in the room. The floor is made of a similar material, but it is covered with a thick layer of soft moss that feels like walking on clouds.
> 
> The centerpiece of the room is a large circular pool of water, perfectly still and crystal clear. You notice that there are small ripples forming on the surface, as if something beneath it is moving. As you approach, you see that there are tiny metallic fish swimming just below the surface, their scales shimmering in the light.
> 
> Surrounding the pool are several stone pillars, each one intricately carved with symbols and patterns that seem to shift and change as you look at them. They seem to be arranged in a particular pattern, almost like they are part of some grand design.
> 
> You notice that there are several cushions scattered around the room, inviting you to sit and relax.
> 
> You close your eyes and take a deep breath. The air smells fresh and crisp, like being out in nature after a rainstorm. You hear nothing but the gentle sound of water lapping against stone.

## 24 - Station AI

> You enter the room, and it's dimly lit by a soft blue glow emanating from the walls. The air is stale and musty, and the room is filled with a low hum that reverberates through your bones. In the center of the room, you see a large pillar of black metal rising up from the floor, with wires and cables snaking out from it in all directions.
> 
> A voice echoes through the room and the pillar pulses in synchronicity with it, but it seems to be speaking in a language you can't understand, low and guttural. It seems to be malfunctioning, glitching out every few seconds and emitting bursts of static. Despite its apparent malfunction, you can sense an intelligence behind its words, something ancient and otherworldly.

## 25 - Escape Pods

> As you enter the room, the first thing that catches your attention is the haunting emptiness.
> 
> In the center of the room, there is a large circular platform with several round slots around its perimeter. You can see that these slots must have been filled with something, but they are now empty. The platform itself seems to be made of some kind of smooth metal, with no visible seams or joints.
> 
> As you move closer to investigate, you notice that there are strange markings etched into the metal surface of the platform. They seem to be some kind of language or code, but you cannot decipher them. You notice that each slot has a small panel next to it, which also bears similar markings.
> 
> The walls are lined with cabinets and lockers, all sealed shut. You can see through their glass panels that they contain some kind of equipment that is unlike anything you have ever seen before. There are rows of glowing tubes and coils, circuit boards and wires tangled together in intricate patterns.


## 26 - Storage Room

> You find yourselves in a tiny, cramped storage room that smells of musty metal and stale air. The walls are lined with strange, angular shelves that seem to be made of some sort of black glass or obsidian. The shelves are filled with bizarre objects that you cannot identify, ranging from small, glowing orbs to twisted bits of metal that look like they were once part of some larger machine. 
> 
> The room itself is barely large enough for you to stand up straight in, and the ceiling presses uncomfortably close to your head. The only light comes from a faint glow emanating from the strange objects on the shelves, casting eerie shadows across the walls. The air is thick with dust and a strange static energy that makes your hair stand on end.


## Transition Rooms

###  1 - Administrative Offices

>  As you step into the room, you are struck by a strange sensation that makes the hair on your arms stand on end. You are lightheaded momentarily, but then the feeling passes.
> 
>  The place appears to be a large office space, and the first thing that catches your attention is the overwhelming sense of symmetry. The walls are lined with identical, hexagonal panels that seem to reflect each other infinitely. The floor and ceiling are also made up of these panels, creating a disorienting effect as if you were standing in a never-ending tunnel.

### 2 - Bathrooms

> As you step into the room, you are struck by a strange sensation that makes the hair on your arms stand on end. You are lightheaded momentarily, but then the feeling passes.
> 
> You notice the walls are made of a strange, metallic material that gleams with an otherworldly sheen. The air is cool and damp, and you can hear the faint sound of water dripping in the distance. The room is divided into several sections, each containing a series of cubicles that resemble ornate, glass-enclosed coffins.
> 
> Inside each cubicle is a strange contraption that looks like a cross between a toilet and a shower. There are no visible buttons or levers on any of the devices, but as you step closer, you notice they seem to respond to your presence. A soft glow emanates from within, and a faint humming sound fills the air.
> 
> As you explore further into the room, you notice there are several large basins filled with a clear liquid that glows with an eerie blue light. You dip your hand into one of them and feel a tingling sensation as the liquid seems to absorb into your skin.


### 3 - Bar

> As you step into the room, you are struck by a strange sensation that makes the hair on your arms stand on end. You are lightheaded momentarily, but then the feeling passes.
> 
> In the center is a circular bar-top that dominates the center of the space. It's massive, easily ten feet in diameter, and made from some sort of dark, polished material that glimmers faintly under the dim lighting. The bar-top is surrounded by padded stools with torn upholstery.
> 
> As you approach the bar, you notice that there are bottles scattered everywhere. Some are tipped over or smashed on the ground, spilled liquids mixing into an unappetizing puddle. The ones still standing are mostly empty, with only a few dregs clinging to the bottom. Some of the drinks still have garnishes - bright red half-moon shapes and slices of some kind of pink fruit.
> 
> Tables line the edge of the room, each with plates of cold food left untouched. You can see a half-eaten sandwich on one plate and a bowl of soup congealing on another. It's clear that this place hasn't been used in a long time.
> 
> The floor crunches underfoot as you move further into the room. Broken glass glitters in patches, reflecting what little light there is back at you. It's hard to imagine what could have caused such destruction in this once-lively space.


### 4 - Customs Office

> As you step into the room, you are struck by a strange sensation that makes the hair on your arms stand on end. You are lightheaded momentarily, but then the feeling passes.
> 
> In this room, there is an eerie silence and an emptiness within the space. The walls are lined with strange, otherworldly machines that appear to be scanners or detectors of some kind. The air is still and musty, and a layer of dust covers the surfaces.
> 
> In the center of the room, there is a large, circular platform with a glowing panel in the middle. The panel is dark and inactive. On the walls, there are various symbols and diagrams, but they are unintelligible to you.
> 
> The room is filled with various consoles and screens, displaying information rows of information. Some of the screens flicker and emit static, while others are completely dark. It is clear that this was once a busy office, but now it is deserted and forgotten.


### 5 - Crew Lounge

> As you step into the room, you are struck by a strange sensation that makes the hair on your arms stand on end. You are lightheaded momentarily, but then the feeling passes.
> 
> You enter the room and are immediately struck by the opulence of it. Plush leather couches and chairs are arranged in a cozy circle around a low table, inviting you to sink into their soft embrace. The walls are covered in shimmering metallic wallpaper, reflecting the dim lighting from overhead fixtures. In one corner, a minibar stands empty, its contents long since picked clean by previous visitors.

> As you settle into one of the chairs, you notice several black slabs scattered around the room. They blare static, their colors flickering and dancing in the dim light.

### 6 - Holographic Theater

> As you step into the room, you are struck by a strange sensation that makes the hair on your arms stand on end. You are lightheaded momentarily, but then the feeling passes.
> 
> It is dark in this room, save for beams of light emanating from some unknown source in the ceiling. In the center of the room lies a stage, circular and raised, with a ring of seats surrounding it.
> 
> As you get closer, you can see that there are figures projected onto the stage in three dimensions, flickering in and out. They are strange humanoid creatures with ant-like features. Their bodies are covered in a hard, dark carapace that glimmers in the dim light. They move with an eerie grace, their movements fluid and precise.
> 
> They seem to be acting out a play, obviously unfamiliar to you. The characters speak in a language you don't understand, but their emotions are clear.
> 
> The set, also constructed of projected beams of light, is elaborate and intricate, depicting towering cities made of metal and glass.


### 7 - Security Office

> As you step into the room, you are struck by a strange sensation that makes the hair on your arms stand on end. You are lightheaded momentarily, but then the feeling passes.
> 
> The room is dimly lit, with a wall of screens looming in front of you. They flicker with static and distorted images, making it impossible to discern any useful information. The console beneath gleams with an array of polished buttons and knobs.
> 
> The walls are lined with shelves, but they are barren save for a few rusted metal boxes. The floor is littered with debris, including broken glass and scraps of metal that crunch under your boots as you move deeper into the space.


### 8 - Cargo Hold

> As you step into the room, you are struck by a strange sensation that makes the hair on your arms stand on end. You are lightheaded momentarily, but then the feeling passes.
> 
> The air is thick with a musty scent, as if decades of dust and neglect have settled in the room. The space is vast, with towering shelves that stretch high into the shadows above. Wires dangle from exposed panels in the ceiling, hinting at long-gone machinery that once hummed with life.
> 
> The shelves themselves are a curious mix of shapes and sizes, some large enough to hold a small cottage while others barely big enough for a single book. You notice strange markings etched along their surfaces, intricate patterns that seem to shift and twist before your eyes. You can't help but feel a sense of unease as you approach them.
> 
> A few crates sit haphazardly on the floor, their contents long since vanished or rotted away. A thick layer of dust covers everything like a shroud, undisturbed by any living creature in years.


## The Cube Room

> You come to a room that is unlike any other. It is ancient, made entirely of black obsidian that seems to absorb all light. The walls are smooth and featureless, with no signs of wear or tear from the passage of time.
> 
> In the center of the room, suspended in mid-air, is a cube that defies all logic. As you approach it, the cube seems to shift and change before your very eyes, folding in on itself over and over again. Its surface is covered in intricate patterns and symbols that seem to pulse with an otherworldly energy.
> 
> The cube appears to be floating with some kind of invisible force that holds it aloft. As you study it more closely, you can see that there are smaller cubes within the larger one, each one seemingly identical to the last but somehow different.



## Ideas

The Halcacion Cube contains the remains of a space station belonging to a long-dead alien civilization. The cube itself resembles a menger cube, created by The Spiral, one of the Dread, chaos gods from the Dark Between. The space station has been turned in to a fractal maze, each corridor and room potentially leading into a deeper copy. The station is also hunted by Wedge Fiends, devious creatures that hunt the space between worlds and enter the physical realm through right corners.
