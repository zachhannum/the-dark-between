#### Luminous Magic
**Convictions of Transmutation** `jsx:<D8/>`
Shani has chosen to focus her studies as an Acronist on *Transmutation*. She excels at manifesting Convictions related to changing and manipulating what objects and creatures are made of. The more complex and object is, the harder it is to transmute---living creatures are by far the hardest. The closer the target material is to the source, the easier the transmutation will be. For example, it's easier for Shani to transmute a rock to sand than to water.
- *Fixed Truth*: When manifesting a conviction related to Transmutation Manipuation, spend a PP to create a `jsx:<D8/>` asset out of the manifestation.

#### Signature Asset
