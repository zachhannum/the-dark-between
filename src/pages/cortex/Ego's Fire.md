list from #naos/character and #villain-backstory
```

One of the professors at the Basentia, [[Adam La Cour]], is investigating an ancient cult known as [[The Church of Aphothis]] and invites [[Rikkart Lauten]] along with a number of other talented students to help him activate it, rather recklessly. La Cour knows that there is *something* strange with Aphothis and it's followers, but he doesn't really know details. He simply wants to be able to take credit for discovering something that no one knows about. He invites the students on a journey to some far-off ancient ruins in [[Tharsis]] as a sort of “school field trip”. He tells them they will be summoning a manifestion of the Primal Fire to capture for research and he wants them along because they are some of the most prominent students at the University.

#### Important NPCs
- [[Kalia Samira]] - Professor at the Basentia, older woman, teaches Botany
- [[Adam La Cour]] - Professor at the Basentia, teaches [[Convergence]]

#### Luminous Magic
The *Luminous Magic* trait will have a single Conviction specialization related to the character's specialization as an Acronist. This will usually be a broad definition of the types of Convictions the character is particularly strong at, such as Augery, Material Manipulation, Imbuement, Elemental Manipulation, etc.

At least one *SFX*, *Fixed Truth* is attached to this trait:
When manifesting a conviction related to adhesion, spend a PP to create a `jsx:<D8/>` asset out of the manifestation.

If a hitch is rolled when using Luminous Magic, the *Thread Fatigue* stress is applied.

### Plot
- Getting Detention
- Clearing out the Earth Spirits
- Preparation for the trip --- introduction of Rikkary Lauten
- La Cour takes them back to Artifact Storage to pull out the [[Junction]], a stone archway, that will take them to their destination
- Power the junction and go through it, ending up ancient desert city
- start foreshadowing storm
- camp for the night
- A Tharshan patrol shows up. They occasionaly patrol the city to look out for bandits and graverobbers. They are understandably suspicious of the party. Rysha recognizes their signet—its one of her House's
- Inside the temple, do timed challenges for traps, possibly [timed traps](https://discord.com/channels/623006378209968129/704728459288772820/915735387295580236)
- If at any point the party becomes suspicious of La Cour, he is not opposed to separating the party or taking them out. 
- Rikkart will always want to do it. His ego and hubris are too great—he wants to make a name for himself
- Ritual takes place at a  Sanctum of Aphothis. The Sanctums are a place that contain layers upon layers of Convictions throughout generations, and as a result they are places where the barrier between the mortal realm and the rest of reality is thin
- La Cour's plan is to get them into the Sanctum of Aphothis and initiate a ritual to activate the Sanctum. The truth is, though, even he doesn't really know what he's discovered. Only bits of text here and there describing the Aphothians and their god, and has no idea that the ritual will attempt to sacrifice them.
- Rikkart will be at the center of it, and his [[Thread]] will burn with a black fire, turning him into a [[Fade|Fade]].
- Abominations from The Dark Between will come through, and La Cour will be taken by madness, clawing at his own eyes, screaming about the Darkness.
- Meanwhile, the city will start to crumble, starting with the Sanctum. The students will have limited time to grab Rikkart and get back to the Junction as quickly as possible.

## Introduction
> We see an island—Aljieudum—layered in a blanket of white as the winter in the far North sets in. As we get closer,  we zoom in on Meripol, the largest city on Aljiedum, set upon a series of tall plateaus along ocean cliffs. An overwhelming number of towers and spires of varying heights loom over the deep canyons between each plateau. Large Aerostats float high above the city, entering and exiting the massive Prismagates that sit atop the tallest building on the center plateau. We eventually come to a set of buildings on the eastern plateau, built from dark, smooth stone. The Basentia Omnia, a storied University that houses and trains some of the most talented Acronists in all of Selar. Wide, well-kept lawns with exquisite topiaries separate each of the buildings. Paved walking paths twist and turn around the campus, and students dressed in long coats and furs hustle briskly to their classes, eager for the semester to end and the Illuminaris, a winter festival celebrated in Aljiedum, to begin. We make our way to one of the building’s tall spires, through a stained window and into a small but comfortable office, where we find four students sitting across from the desk of Professor Kalia Samira. A stern-faced woman, she peers at the four of you from behind the round glasses perched at the edge of her nose in dissaproval.

Professor Samira will ask the PCs if they know why they are here. Out of character tell them they are being reprimanded and prompt them to think of a reason. If they can't, rp it as if they are playing dumb and use these reasons:
- Jules - poor attendance "You've missed 20 classes just this month, Mr. Kaplan. Don't think that your name is an excuse to get away from these sorts of things."
- Faro - beating up seniors again "Mr Desjardins, I know you mean well, but you must let Professors handle disputes between upper and lower classmen"
- Rysha - blew up a science laboratory "There is a reason, Ms. Mei, that we have safety precautions in labs. Any experimentation outside of coursework should be approved by teacher"
- Shani - turned water jugs in the dining hall into wine "And finally Ms. Mirza. Transmuting water into wine in the dining hall." She just shakes her head at this one

Samira tells them that beause of their actions, they will be spending the winter festival in detention.  She has two tasks for them:

1. Some minor Earth Spirits have manifested in one of the storerooms. They are to go there and clear them out. Samira reminds them to destory their spirit shards so that they are banished permanately.
2. Afterwards, they are to spend the rest of the break transcribing ancient texts in the library.

Ideally, the PCs can protest and try and get out of detention. If they appeal to hear and defeat a Easy `jsx:<D4/>` test, Samira will let them get out of transcribing texts. She thinks for a moment, then remembers that Professor La Cour was looking for exceptional students to help with an extracurricular assignment over the holiday. If they say they are exceptional: "Mr./Ms. blank, all students at the Basentia are exceptional." If they would prefer, they can help with his "field trip".

If they don't try and get out of detention, a knock at the door will interrupt them. Professor La Cour steps in and is surprised to see the PCs. He asks what they are doing. He will suggest the same thing, that he is looking for exceptional students. If this happens, describe him as carrying an old leatherbound book.

Either way, before they leave, Samira says:
> And do act quickly regarding the Earth Spirits. They showed up yesterday and have already caused damage to several priceless artifices. Remember to destroy the spirit core---they won't be destroyed, otherwise.

### Bridge Scene
Ask any of the PCs if they want to do anything before proceeding.

## Detention
Some minor Earth Spirits have been causing trouble in one of the storerooms at the University. They have been tasked with clearing them out before they cause too much damage.

> The four of you find yourselves standing in the cold. A biting wind that is typical for this time of year howls through the buildings. Before you stands on of the Basentia's most interesting buildings---Artifact Storage. Objects of varying arcane power are carefully catalogued and stored here for safekeeping. As you step up to the doors, you hear a crash of shattering glass from inside.

Inside the storeroom, the players find a mob of **Minor Earth Spirits**

### The Junction to Mehnateruna
> You all arrive at Artifact Storage at the appointed time. Professor La Cour is already there, along with another student: Rikkart Lauten, the school's most prodigious student, known for his extraordinary talent with Magic.

Professor La Cour welcomes the party and asks if they are ready. Once they are ready, he leads them down one of the rows of crates towards the back of this particular storeroom and stops before an artifact standing on the floor, approximately 15 feet tall and 10 feet across, covered by a large beige sheet. La Cour asks for help from Faro and pulls the sheet off, revealing the Junction.

> The two of you pull the sheet off, revealing what appears to be an ornate stone archway, ruins carved into the face of the rock along the top. It looks old, but in surprisingly good shape. "This", La Cour says, "Is a junction to Mehnateruna." He extracts a leatherbound journal from his bag, deftly unlocking the cover with a key around his neck and begins pouring through it, evidently looking for a specific page.


When the Junction becomes active, a mirror-like appearance fills the archway. When somone touches the surface, it ripples like liquid. The air on the other side feels warm and dry.

Once they step through:
> You find yourselves momentarily blinded by bright sunlight. As your eyes adjust, you can make out your surroundings. The vibrant sun casts warm light onto an ancient, empty city. On the horizon, you make make out the dark thunderheads of a storm in the distance. Looking out across a circular terrace, you see a vast city of pale stone buildings, overtaken by dune sands. The architecture is like nothing you've ever seen, walls intrically carved with patterns, domed rooftops, statues depicting unfamiliar creatures. You are very clearly no longer in Aljieudum.

Professor will gladly explain Mehnateruna to them, but obviously omit any details about the [[Church of Aphothis]].

[[Rysha Tan Mei]] will have heard of Mehnateruna and might recognize the place.

### The Matorei
As they are making their way through the empty city, have each of the students make a Notice roll against a `jsx:<D6/>` Test. La Cour is too absorbed in navigating with the book to notice. Those that succeed hear faint voices and the winny of horses from up ahead.

It is a small patrol of [[Matorei]], Royal Guardsmen from House Tan Mei. They are dressed in stark white armor with scarlet feathered helmets, carrying spears. Rysha will obviously recognize them. The Leader of the patrol identifies himself as [[Tano Ha Sidon]]. The Matorei will think the group are graverobbers and attempt to apprehend them. Rysha will be able to easily persuade them to leave them alone. They will not recognize her at first, but if she brings it up, Tano will immediately dismount from his horse and bend a knee for her.

#### The City of Mehnateruna
[[Mehnateruna]] is an ancient city located in [[Tharsis]] that was a part of the [[Kingdom of Lashana]]. Mehnateruna was a popular trade city, and was a bustling metropolis, once. They were known to have worshipped the [[Primal Spirit of Fire]] as their patron diety. 

What is lesser-known, however, is that long after Lashana fell into ruin, Mehnateruna became home to a group of cultists known as the [[Church of Aphothis]]. The Church of Aphothis did not worship any of the Spirits or the Luminary. They instead worshipped The Dark, [[The Altrement]]. They modified the Spirit Sanctum in Mehnateruna to serve their god and rigged it with various traps to keep others out. Up until now, [[Tharsis]] has not done significant work excavating the ruins, though they are a common target for graverobbers and treasure hunters.

##### The Sanctum of Aphothis
> Professor La Cour looks up from his book at last as you all approach the steps to a vast building, its walls and pillars carved with detailed patterns.

The Aphothians took advantage of the Spirit Sanctum already existing in Mehnateruna as a place where the borders of the mortal realm were thin and layered their own convictions on top of it, carving runes into the very rock and giving the sanctum a new purpose: become a place of power for their new god. This new sanctum was built to make offerings to Aphothis by severing the [[Thread|Threads]] of sacrifices. The burst of energy released when a Thread is severed within the Sanctum opens a window into The Dark Between. Eventually, the cult wiped itself out and was pulled in to the Dark, never to be seen again.

Have the path to the Sanctum be relatively straightforward but blocked by a mound of rubble. Rikkart will attempt to use his Spirit Summoning to manifest an Earth Elemental to move the rubble.

##### The Ritual
> The Sanctum stands before you, a massive rotunda open to the sky above. It appears as though the roof was once domed, decorated with murals. But the ages have long since marred the paint beyond recognition, and the roof seems to have collapsed at some point. Dark clouds now roil overhead. A light rain has begun, making the stone in the center of the room slightly darker. Distant thunder can be heard. Along the stone floor, you can see concentric circles expertly carved, taking up the majority of the room. The circles and curves seem to form a complex pattern that is all but indiscernable to you. In the center of the room is a raised platform. The patterns cut into the sides of the dais and seem to converge on the the center. In the middle of the platform, you see some sort of apparatus with mechanical gears---for those  that have studied astronomy it seems to be a representation of a solar system, planets the size of two fists that are able to follow orbits around a larger pale blue orb in the center. The Luminary.

The apparatus at the center of the room was built to represent the cosmos that was believed to be at the time by the Aphothians to help guide their Convictions to the Altrement.

Upon closer inspection

> La Cour begins to recite from his book, chanting in a long-forgotten language. A minute passes, and the only thing you notice at first is that the rain has begun to fall heavier. A flash of lightning illuminates the scene in harsh light, and the thunder that follows seems to shake the very foundation of the Sanctum. Then, beneath your feet, white fire begins to flow through the patterns in the floor, moving like liquid to fill in the space. In a matter of seconds it makes it's way from the edges of the room to the center, flowing up into the apparatus. Slowly, the gears start to turn, the planets jerk into motion,  launching into orbit around the Luminary. The light stops at Rikkart's feet. His head jerks back suddenly, and his body glows with the same bright white as it begins to rise from the ground. You feel a force against you, as if the pressure in the center of the room has increased ten-fold. In a brilliant flash of light, a strand of pure energy emits from Rikkar'ts chest into the sky beyond the clouds above. It seems to suspend him in the air. Then, the entire building shudders in protest of something. Something is wrong. Rikkart screams, and the strand above him writhes, tossing his body back and forth. A black fire seems to erupt from it all at once, consuming the light. You hear a sickening sound, like a musical string being pulled taught and snapping. There is a bright flash, blinding you, and then your world goes dark.

Have everyone make a `jsx:<D8/>` test to avoid being injured in the shockwave.

#### Escape From Mehnateruna

> You come to, and in between flashes of lightning snaking across the sky, you can see that dark void has formed in the center of the room above the apparatus, seeming to twist and warp the space around it. Rikkart's body lay motionless on the ground a few yards from the platform. You hear an otherwordly noise as the void takes shape, a dark looming form of surging limbs and slimy flesh, the rain making it's mass glisten. It shudders to the ground, swaying as it's uncomprehensible shape settles into reality. Professor La Cour, who must have fallen backwards, stares up at the creature in stunned shock.
