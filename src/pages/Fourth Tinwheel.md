## Transcript

*The tinwheel recorder is pressed, and we hear the sound of instruments whirring in the background.*

ENZO: This is Dr. Enzo Quint, recording my latest experiment regarding the strange phenomenon around thread severance, and it's connection to the place known as the Dark Between. Ari, the Bifurcator?

ARI: Enzo... are you sure we should be doing this? We have no idea what is going to happen.

ENZO: We understand the risks, Ari. As does Mr. Tulls. Jurrin, please read from the page before you.

*Jurrin's voice comes from behind a pane of glass, slightly muffled and shakey.*

JURRIN: M-My name is Jurrin Tulls. I am an engineer at the Bathysward, and I am participating in this endeavor of my own free will, understanding that I will have my thread severed. I willingly accept all risks.

ENZO: Thank you, Jurrin. Empyreal, you may begin.

*The sound of heavy footsteps can be heard along with clanging metal as the Bifurfactor is placed on Jurrin's chest. Jurrin breathes heavily.*

ENZO: I am activating the device, now.

ARI: What... what happened?

ENZO: Mr. Tulls? Can you hear us?

*Jurrin's voice is now distorted an echoey.*

JURRIN: I see.... yes..... yes.... I seeeee.

ARI: Luminary above, what's wrong with his eyes? Enzo, what have we done?!

*Jurrin continues to babble in the background.*

JURRIN: The end and the beginning, and... nothing... yes I see it, not meant for our eyes, not meant for this woooorllldd...

*Glass begins to crack. Sensors begin to whirr wildly, and alarms start blaring.*

ENZO: Jurrin? Jurrin? 

*The glass encasing Jurrin shatters, and the lab errupts into chaos.*

ARI: Enzo, we have to run!

ENZO: The tinwheel, Ari! The---

*The tinwheel cuts off abruptly.*
