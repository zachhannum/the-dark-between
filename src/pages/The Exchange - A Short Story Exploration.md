Kuri stepped into the icy waters, the stone floor rough against his bare feet. The cold metal of his amulet burned against his chest as he tried to take deep breaths. The dark pool before him did not seem welcoming as it had before. It knew what he had planned. The sheer walls of the domed room loomed over him, as if trapping him inside.

“Remember your training, Kuri.” Professor Lufonte stood behind Kuri by the door. “You've made contact before. This time, you're just going to go a little further. This is an essential step in becoming an Acronist.”

Kuri nodded weakly. Before he could convince himself to do otherwise, he plunged into the pool. A shock ran through him and he tasted bitter salt. When he surfaced he saw that Lufonte and closed the door, leaving him in near-darkness. He attempted to steel his nerves, closing his eyes and focusing his mind.

He lay on his back, the briney water allowing him to float with ease as he stretched his limbs out. He focused on the water. On the cold power of it. The vastness of it. He let those feelings flow into him. The wonder, but also the fear. It took him a few minutes, but eventually the world fell away. All of his senses became muted, and he lost himself in the expanse. A boundless ocean opened up before him.

He felt it. His Thread. An ephemeral strand of pure white that flowed from his heart and into the sky above. It seemed to billow in a breeze that he did not feel.

Looking down, waves lapped at his shins. As before, he stood on some solid, unseen surface hidden beneath the waterline. He took a tentative step forward, trusting that he would not fall into the depths below.

He wondered what the realm of Primal Water looked like to others. To him, this vast endless sea represented the power of the Spirit of Water—the incalculable force of nature. Of life.
