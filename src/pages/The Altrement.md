*I've seen the dark between worlds! I've seen the lightless eye that does not watch but sees all! Out in the dark, in the space between everything we know, is madness.*

[[The Lightless Eye]]

The Dark Between, or the Altrement, represents the true chaos of the world. It's the infinite meaninglessness of the universe. So much of our time is spent up just trying to understand it, trying and catalog and write our own rules for how it should work. 

The Between is the infinite space separating everything we know and everything we don't know. It's the creeping unknown just outside the edge of your vision. The everything that the Universe is not. Outside of the fundamental rules of existence is not nothing. It's chaos.

The Altrement is the space between Universes—a realm outside of any physical or metaphysical .
