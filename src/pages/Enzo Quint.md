## Research into [[The Altrement]]

Quint began research into the Dark Between when he inadvertently discovered that a Thread resonating at a certain frequency could access a portion of the Altrement. At first, he did not know what he had discovered. His discovery came about as the result of underground research he was performing on the effects of Threads being severed from living creatures, more specifically the types of energy realized during the process.

Within a year, he had expanded his research to begin to understand what the Altrement was and how it could be harnessed. His studies brought the attention of [[Vera Lauten]]. The Lauten Family began bankrolling Quint’s research–Vera put her brother’s name on the Statements which were hidden carefully at the [[Central Bank of Meripol]] along with Enzo’s lockbox containing the first tape. Once he fully realized the danger the Altrement posed to Naos, he vowed to stop his research entirely, attempting to hide his findings. Vera kidnapped Quint and forced him to continue his analysis of the dark, attempting to find ways to weaponize the Altrement for personal gain.

### Inventions

His research into the Altrement, and more specifically the discoveries he made in [[Mehnateruna]] and [[Gris]], led him to create [[Lotus]], a drug which can be used to bring a person’s [[Thread]] close to the physical realm. Used in conjunction with a [[Bifurcator]], [[Liminal Bubble|Liminal Bubble’s]] can be created, offering passage between the physical realm and [[The Altrement|The Dark Between]]. Generally when this happens, Chaos from the Dark will manifest as physical creatures.

### Audio Tapes
Quint created six audio tapes, using [[Memory]], related to his research into the Altrement. When he realized that Vera wanted to weaponize it, he hid the tapes in various locations.

Hiding Places:
1. A lockbox at the [[Central Bank of Meripol]], along with a number of papers incriminating [[Rikkart Lauten]] and the [[Sonxai]]
2. Beneath the floorboards of his house, discovered by the [[Vigil]].
3. In the [[Bathyslab]]
4. With [[Ari Vochard]]
5. With the Real [[Rikkart Lauten]] in [[Gris]].
6. With his daughter, [[Eileen Quint]]
	- Given to the [[Saetorim Institute]]

#### The First Tape
In the [[The First Tinwheel|first tape]] Quint records regarding his rearch into the Dark, he discusses some interesting research he found regarding ancient religions in Aljieudum. He mentions one by name, [[The Church of Aphothis]], and how their beliefs did not seem to align with the proto-Argent system that was developing around the same time. They seem to have been involved with some sort of human sacrifices, with a particular focus on severing the thread of the victims. In this tape, he sounds particularly disgusted by it, but fascinated.

#### The Second Tape
The [[The Second Tinwheel|second tinwheel]] Quint records takes place in the ruins of [[Mehnateruna]], the ancient city in which [[The Church of Aphothis]] resided. Enzo states that it was very difficult to obtain any information on the city or its whereabouts. He, along with a small team, have excavated the remains of the Spirit Sanctum in which the Church enacted its rituals. He mentions in the tape that this place is where [[Rikkart Lauten]] and a number of other students were led to, where Rikkart’s thread was severed in an accidental ritual. Enzo states that the Lauten family has refused to speak with him on the matter. He also suspects that the Family is responsible for the lack of information about the city.

#### The Fourth Tape
Takes place in the Bathyslab during one of their Thread experiments. They sever a man’s Thread and he sees the Dark Between, then becomes an Umbral. Enzo mentions Ari by name in the tape, asking him to adjust some valves. Ari hisses at him not to mention him by name. Their experiment fails and the Bathyslab is lost.

#### The Third Tape
Takes place after Enzo returned from Gris. Enzo has realized that he was still missing a key component to his experiments, and had travelled to Gris in order to figure it out. There, he discovered [[The Lightless Eye]], a sect that believes in [[The Altrement]]. He learns techniques from them, and buys some of their technology from them. He also mentions Rikkart in this tape, since he sees him in Gris, but its worded in a way that can be misconstrued as working with him as they already suspect.

#### The Fifth Tape
Vera is revealed. Enzo argues with her, telling her he won’t help with her plans. If he knew what he was really doing

#### The Sixth Tape
The [[The S|sixth and final tape]] that Quint recorded makes vague mentions to his research into the Altrement and that he has decided to stop. He pronounces that there are five other tapes and that he has hidden them in secure locations. Quint is interrupted by his daughter informing him that there is a [[Deep Dwellers|Msanti]] downstairs. Quint makes his way down without turning the tape off. An argument is heard, followed by a loud thump as Quint is knocked *unconcious*. The Msanti makes its way upstairs and shuts the tape off.
