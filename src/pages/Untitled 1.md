Come up with a mantra or motto for a fantasy city guard that has 4 different cohorts: Dawn, Day, Dusk, and Night. In the centuries prior, each of the 4 cohorts would be lead by someone representing each part of the daily cycle. They believed that to watch over the city, they must do so during all hours of the day, and each cohort would be responsible for each part of the day. Don't make it cheesy, it should be poetic though.

From dawn's first light to night's dark veil,
We guard this city, strong and hale.
With steadfast hearts and watchful eyes,
Our duty calls, we shall not compromise.

In unity we stand, four cohorts strong,
Each with our time to right the wrongs.
Dawn brings hope and new beginnings,
Day keeps order and prevents misgivings.

Dusk brings calm as shadows fall,
Night protects from danger's thrall.
We are the guardians of this place,
Our motto clear: we guard with grace.

So let it be known throughout the land,
Our city is safe beneath our hand.
From sunrise to moonrise, we never rest,
Protecting all who call it home, we are truly blessed.
