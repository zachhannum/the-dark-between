# Character Creation
https://tamas-rabel.github.io/cortex/sheet.html
Trait Sets:
* Distinctions
* Attributes
* Skills + Specialties
* Abilities
* Signature Assets

## Concept
Before creating any traits or assigning dice, the most important step in character creation is your **Concept**. Consider the type of character you want to play, what sort of role your character would like to have in the story. Think about what their upringing was like, their personality, and the sorts of abilities you want your character to have. 

Do you want to play a powerful *Farseeker* who manipulates the threads of space and gravity? Or perhaps a *Deep Dweller* working for the Holden Corporation maintaining underground pipelines. Use *The Dark Between* campaign setting to help generate ideas. Once you have a solid concept in mind, you can move on to creating your character’s **Trait Sets**.

## Distinctions
**Distinctions** are a Character’s most important trait set. Characters have **three** distinction traits that give establish their background, personality, role in the story, ancestory, vocation, or heritage. It is up to you to decide what these distinctions are—for some characters, their ancestory might be important to them. For others, their profession. Work with the DM to come up with the best distinctions that fit with your character’s **Concept**.

### SFX
Traits, including Disctinctions, sometimes have *SFX* attached to them, which are kinds of “bonuses” or “benefits” that occur when certain stipulations are met.

All Distinctions get the **Hinder** distinction: “Gain a PP when you switch out this distinction’s 8 for a 4”

In addition, **The Dark Between** characters will get 3 more **SFX** to distribute across their distinctions as they see fit. Work with the DM to determine exactly what these SFX are—certain ancestories, backgrounds, or vocations may come with specific **SFX**. More *SFX* can be added to distinctions through *Character Growth*.

## Attributes
Attributes start at 8. An attribute may be stepped down to step another attribute up. No attribute may start higher than 10.
* Strength - Represents physical strength of a character
* Dexterity - Represents the physical dexterity of a character
* Intellect - Represents the individual's cognitive abilities and problem-solving skills. 
* Awareness - Represents a character's perception and ability to sense things happening around them
* Conviction - Represents a character's magical conviction and ability to maintain their magical powers. A high conviction stat indicates a strong belief in one's magic and a firm control over their abilities.

## Skills
Skills start at 4. At creation, Players have 9 step-up points. Starting out, skills have a max rating of 10.
* Athletics
* Acrobatics
* Combat
* Deception
* Engineering
* Intimidation
* Knowledge
* Medicine
* Perception
* Performance
* Persuasion
* Sleight of Hand
* Stealth

### Skill Specialties
Start at a rating of 6 and can be upgraded, no specific list. Characters start out with 1 specialty. More can be added through *Character Growth*.

## Abilities
Characters start with 3 **Abilities**, traits that represent powers or aptitudes that go above and beyond the average person in the world. For *Acronists*, these abilities represent the 3 aspects of their chosen Primal Spirit. For other characters, their abilities can represent a number of different things depending on their concept—special equipment, weapons, gear, or specific powers/traits inherited from their ancestory or background. Each character starts with two 6 rated abilities, one 8 rated ability, and a single SFX attached to each ability. Higher ratings and more SFX can be added through *Character Growth*.

## Signature Assets
Characters start with a single **Signature Asset**, rated 6, which represents a particularly iconic weapon, item, pet, or something else entirely that is tied to the Character. Signature assets can also represent more nebulous things, such as relationships with important organizations or characters within the world.

## Creating SFX

For Distinctions and Abilities, players can create SFX, short for "special effect". These take the form of a *benefit* or *special bonus* that can occur under certain conditions. They are a way to break from the normal rules of the game, modify the outcome of tests and contests, and add more flavor to the story.

### Creating SFX

One way to look at SFX is as a combination of a cost and a benefit. The standard SFX has the cost of "use the distinction as a 4" and the benefit "earn a PP".

Here's a list of sample costs to choose from:

* Spend a PP
* Step down a beneficial die (usually an attribute, skill, or asset)
* Step up a non-beneficial die (usually a complication or stress)
* Choose to do or introduce something risky/ill-advised/complicated ("When you walk into a volatile situation and cause trouble...")
* Create an 8 complication
* Shut down a trait set

Here are some example benefits:

* Earn a PP
* Add a 6 to your dice pool
* Step up a beneficial die (usually a specialty or asset)
* Double a beneficial die
* Step down a non-beneficial die (usually a complication or stress)
* Introduce a non-mechanical story detail
* Rename a complication ("I'm not **Sickened**, I'm **Angry**")
* Reroll a single die
* Create an 8 asset for the rest of the scene

Some SFX can switch the cost for a different sort of triggering mechanism, such as getting a heroic success or some other rp-based mechanism. Costs and triggers can also be combined if the SFX's *benefit* is more potent than usual.

### Examples

Here are some example SFX as related to Distinctions and Abilities.

**Expert Marksman 8**<br/>
Your character has trained to become an expert marksman, be it with firearms or more primitive weaponry.
* *Critical Aim*: Spend a PP to step up **Expert Marksman**

**Juggernaut 8**<br/>
Your character is unstoppable in a fight.
* *Guardian*: Spend a PP to suffer Physical stress in place of a nearby ally.

**Energy 8**<br/>
Your character has access to the Primal Aspect of Energy.
* *Absorption*: If your character succeeds in defending against some form of Energy attack, convert your opponent's effect die into a temporary asset to use on your next roll. Spend a PP to use this SFX even if your opponent succeeds.

[The Big Book of SFX](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1JtaYzrwplSxkKZkjd9cUAfXxz_bxxKEFjZGj6QdWuKI/edit#heading=h.ir1ckn1kpuz7) has a very detailed overview of constructing different types of SFX.

# Luminous Magic
Luminous Magic is Magic that is created or performed through [[The Luminary]]. This feat is accomplished through the [[Thread]]. Utilizing the direct connection with the Luminary allows one to bend reality to their will through a [[Conviction]]. Creating anything meaningful with Luminous Magic is no small feat, and although all living creatures on [[Naos]] have a Thread, few can utilize it to distort the fabric of reality to their will. Wielders of Luminous Magic are called [[Acronist|Acronists]].

## Permanent Magic
It is possible for [[Conviction|Convictions]] to become [[Fixed Truth|Fixed Truths]] if the manifestation is strong enough. [[Luminous Magic#Runes|Runes]] can help retain the efficacy of Fixed Truths, though almost all Fixed Truths degrade over time unless regularly maintained or are upheld by a [[Collective Conviction]]. 

## Training
For most denizens of [[Naos]], Luminous Magic requires years of training to form a strong enough [[Conviction]] to manifest any one of the Aspects, usually with the aid of a [[Primal Spirits|Primal Spirit]]. 

## The Law of Diametric Truth
When manifesting [[Conviction|Convictions]], it is the Acronist's *belief*, or *will*, that convinces the Luminary that reality behaves in a certain way. The greater the discripancy between the Acronist's Conviction and the [[Cornerstone]], the greater the potential [[Backlash]].

## Runes
Some cultures on [[Naos]] believe that certain symbols or runes are tied to the different aspects of Primal Spirits and Luminous Magic. The reality is that while these symbols don't intrisincally have any power over certain aspects, it has been found that using runes can aid in the strength of the Conviction formed while casting luminous magic. Runes can also provide a convenient way for Acronists to read and understand certain Fixed Truths that have been laid upon a particular place or item, so are usedemdash as a form of common communication.

## The Primal Spirits
While a particularly talented and rare [[Acronist]] may be able to manifest [[Conviction|Convictions]] with a direct link to [[The Luminary]], *most* do so with the aid of a [[Primal Spirits|Primal Spirit]]. Not only do Primal Spirits allow an Acronist to manifest Convictions of greater magnitude, they also rebuff potential [[Backlash]].

## Approaches
[[Conviction|Convictions]] are manifested using different approaches depending on the desired end result.

### 1st Heirarch | Abecar

**Novus** - Perception, knowing, revealing

**Regus** - Control, Manipulation

### 2nd Heirarch | Gnostis

**Vertus** - Transformation, alters the natural state of being

**Armus** - Resistance, bolsters defences against a specific aspect

### 3rd Heirarch | Kyros

**Parus** - Creation from nothing

**Demus** - Destruction, decay, disintegrate, or diminish

## Loss of Magic

Individuals who have had their [[Thread]] severed are called [[Fade|Fades]], and can no longer manifest Luminous Magic or be directly affected by it.

# Acronists

Acronists are trained wielders of [[Luminous Magic]]. As it takes a great deal of talent and dedication to develop strong [[Conviction|Convictions]], many Acronists studied for many years to become proficient at Magic.

## Pure Acronist
Incredibly rare, Pure Acronists manifest [[Conviction|Convictions]] purely from their self-belief, without the aid of any [[Primal Spirits|Primal Spirit]].

## Primal Acronist
More common bar far, especially in the Eastern lands of [[Selar]] and [[Edelun]], Acronists bind themselves to a [[Primal Spirits|Primal Spirit]], leveraging the Spirit's connection to [[The Luminary]] to more easily manifest Convictions and prevent the worst [[Backlash]].

![Young Acronist attemps to bind the Primal Air|400](./images/Morne_young_male_mage_Magic_ritual_binding_the_spirit_of_air_430bf548-3c2e-44dc-be59-99a967658a7d.png "left center square")

### The Exchange
To bind a [[Primal Spirits|Primal Spirit]], an Acronist must perform [[The Exchange]], a ritual that varies wildly in difficulty and implementation depending on the Spirit and Acronist involved. This Exchange is sometimes permanent, but not always, and some bindings even need to be maintained through consistent ritual by the Acronist.

### The Aspects

Each [[Primal Spirits|Primal Spirit]] is tied to three [[Primal Aspects]], and each Spirit shares two of their Aspects with an adjacent spirit.

### Types of Primal Acronists

The types of Primal Acronists are:

- Furybearer
- Stonesinger
- Farseeker
- Vastcaller
- Boneforger
- Soulrender

#### Furybearers

**Furybearers** are Acronists who have bonded with the Primal Spirit of Fire. They are granted access to the Aspects of _Energy_, _Emotion_, and _Memory_.

#### Stonesingers

**Stonesingers** are Acronists who have bonded with the Primal Spirit of Earth. They are granted access to the Aspects of _Memory_, _Material_, and _Gravity_.

# Primal Spirits

The Primal Spirits are comprised of six powerful beings, created from the [[The Luminary]]. The six primal spirits are [[Primal Spirit of Air|Air]], [[Primal Spirit of Water|Water]], [[Primal Spirit of Earth|Earth]], [[Primal Spirit of Fire|Fire]], [[Primal Spirit of Bone|Bone]], and [[Primal Spirit of Soul|Soul]].

![The Primal Fire|400](./images/Morne_elemental_made_of_pure_fire_abstract_epic_fantasy_art_d353c2e3-5448-48ee-9533-efb4b28684ba.png "center horizontal")

## Origins
In the beginnings of the world, when humans huddled around fires and struggled to survive, they often looked to beings beyond, dieties with power outside of normal comprehension, either to worship or fear or to simply explain how the world around them worked.

In a sense, early humans saw these divine concepts as *Universal Movers*, beings that encompassed various aspects of their lives. In their belief and worship, humanity as a whole catalyzed a collective [[Conviction]] so strong that it these beings were *willed* into existence. Overtime, primordial beings were formed from the faith that existed within humanity. The Convictions that created these beings was so strong that it became a [[Fixed Truth]] in reality, allowing the spirits to continue to exist even as humanity evolved.

## Sentience

![The Primal Bone|400](./images/Morne_The_primal_spirit_of_bone_shape_epic_fantasy_art_77181082-4593-43c8-8536-27138002d0bc.png "right center square")

It is unknown to the denizens of [[Naos]] whether the Primal Spirits are sentient, or simply forces of nature. In truth, the answer is more complex than that. The Primal Spirits themselves are far more complex constructs, both incomprehensible forces and, for lack of a better term, minds. They work as parts of a whole, and there are many instances of physical manifestations of the Primal Spirits coming into existence in the physical world, either pulled by a mortal that lives in it, or simply bubbled into existence by random chance. These manifestations can take many forms, both benign and dangerous. Many have been worshiped and feared as minor gods or monsters in their own right.

In some ways, the Primal Spirits have a “will” of their own, trying to shape the world in their image however they see fit. But they are also vastly incomprehensible, and often their influence on the world is met with fear and awe.

![The Primal Earth|300](./images/Morne_humanoid_made_entirely_out_of_desert_rocks_epic_fantasy_a_57784da2-6351-4f14-ab3a-a92b4b3d883c.png "left center square")

### Intrinsic Values

Since the Primal Spirits were created by and for Humans, each of the spirits is also intrisically tied to certain *values*.  These values influence how the Primal Spirits manifest in the world and their influence on it.

The Primal Earth is tied to the values of *Balance*, *Strength*, and *Neutrality*.

The Primal Air is tied to the values of *Freedom*, *Self*, and *Honesty*.

The Primal Water is tied to the values of *Change*, *Adaptation*, and *Fear*.

The Primal Fire is tied to the values of *Passion*, *Life*, and *Fury*.

The Primal Bone is tied to the values of *Substance*, *Pain*, and *Death*.

The Primal Soul, prior to corruption, was tied to the values of *Thought*, *Morality*, and *Virtue*. In the present, the Primal Soul is tied to the values of *Corruption*, *Manipulation*, and *Ego*.

![The Primal Water|300](./images/Morne_Elemental_of_Water_made_of_ocean_waves_immense_vast_eleme_1e094a07-3c1a-45b3-8cf0-d5828f668604.png "right center vertical")

### Facsimiles of Reality
It is important to note that while the Spirits embody aspects of humanity, they are not true embodiments of what they represent. When they were created, that may of been true, but the Spirits, as semi-conscious immortal beings, have the potential to grow and shift over time of their own accord, and how the world indirectly influences them. The Elemental Spirits are most resistant to change—Rivers will always change the land, and the ocean will always strike fear into those who witness its vastness, but Bone and Soul are more subject to interpretation and change. Soul especially.

### Corruption of the Primal Soul

![The Primal Soul|250](./images/Morne_the_corrupt_primal_spirit_of_the_soul_purple_expressive_e_7e97795f-7d96-44b7-b503-53e0728ed0cc.png "left center vertical")

Of the spirits, Soul was always the most *concious* and aware. While the other Spirits were more animalistic in nature, Soul often manifests with more sentience. Over time, however, as humanity and civilization became more complex, and the understanding of what it means to be good or evil did as well, the Primal Soul became twisted, warping into a representation of the darkest corners of the human soul. While the Primal Soul is merely a reflection, in a way, and cannot be truly evil, this shift led many in the world of [[Naos]] to fear the Primal Soul, and treat it as such. For [[The Argent]], The Primal Soul is seen as the personification of Evil, the wickedness of the heart should [[The Luminary]] not be followed.

## In the Modern Age
In the modern age of Naos, most civilizations treat the Spirits as they are, powerful and primal beings that are vast and potentially dangerous, but not gods. Some civilizations, however, still worship one or more of the spirits as dieties. Some [[Shifter|Shifters]] worship the [[Primal Spirit of Bone]] as a sort of god-like figure. Pockets of Msanti culture worship [[Primal Spirit of Water|Primal Water]]. There are various human cultures that worship the different elemental spirits in more ways than one.


![The Primal Air|400](./images/Morne_The_primal_spirit_of_air_a_vast_wind_fantasy_art_b3efae58-89ac-457f-89e3-af9559f9f751.png "right center horizontal")

## Creation of New Spirits
While it is technically feasible for new spirits to be created, the largely varying cultures and beliefs that make up Naos in the modern age make in very unlikely that new spirits would come about. The rise of logic, reason, and science too make such a *mass* Conviction possible, at least without a deliberate and coordinated effort. The Primal Spirits were a certainly a unique occurrence, and their creation the result of a perfect storm.

## Scions
While extremely rare, it is possible for human-spirit hybrids to be born into the world, known as [[Elemental Scion]]s, or, in even rarer cases, [[Shifter|Shifters]]. Scions are always born from a normal human parentage, and appear mostly human with some unique characteristics. Scions are simply born with an innate connection link to one of the Spirits, and are generally granted abilities based on their Spirit. The only Spirit that does not produce Scions, theoretically, is the [[Primal Spirit of Soul|Primal Soul]].

# The Primal Aspects

The **Primal Aspects** are twelve distinct domains that the six [[Primal Spirits]] are tied to, each Primal Spirit sharing two of its Aspects with other Spirits.

![The Primal Aspects|700](./images/aspects.png "center")

## Energy

The Aspect of **Energy** gives one the ability to create, shape, and manipulate various forms of energy, and are able to transform or convert it into a number of different manifestations. Some common forms of energy that Acronists use are kinetic, radiant, and thermal. This aspect has ties to the power industry and the military, due to it's applications in combat and energy production. _Furybearers_ are some of the most sought after Acronists.

## Memory

The Aspect of **Memory** gives one the domain over the _concept_ of Memory: fabrication, suppression, influence, detection, erasure, and more. Due to the _Law of Aversion_, this aspect is tricky to use on other living creatures without consent, but this Aspect is often used to provide memory restoration and preservation. In rare cases of extraordinarily talented Acronists, _Memory_ is also used to create artificial constructs with sentience.

## Material

The Aspect of **Material** gives one the ability to shape and manipulate _matter_, alter it's physical properties or phase state. Most often, this Aspect is uses by Engineers to aid in the construction of infrastructure or manufacturing.

## Gravity

The Aspect of **Gravity** gives one the domain over the fundamental force of Gravity. Primarily, Convictions of this Aspect relate to increasing or decreasing the Gravitational pull of the environment, individual objects, or in rare cases, living creatures. The Aspect of Gravity is used by the Conveyance Authority to operate gravity-powered trains.

## Space

The Aspect of **Space** gives one the ability to manipulate spatial reality, the boundless three-dimensional extent of the Universe in which objects have relative position and direction. Most commonly, this includes increasing and decreasing the _amount_ of space between points or objects. Most notably, Acronists that use _Space_ create **Junctions**, which are links between two points in the world, allowing for instantaneous travel between places. The most notable of these are **Prismagates**.

## Illusion

The Aspect of **Illusion** gives one the ability to create, shape, and manipulate illusory mirages or simulated reality. These effects are unable to affect reality itself, merely the perceptions of living creatures with Threads.

## Force

The Aspect of **Force** gives one the domain over fundamental forces. Force is a more loosely intepreted Aspect, and it's exact nature is somewehat dependant on the personal beliefs of the Acronist. Most commonly, Force relates to the raw power of Nature, manifesting in the form of wind, storms, and other weather phenomenon.

## Life

The Aspect of **Life** gives one the domain over biological life. Most commonly, this Aspect takes the form of an affinity with plants and animals. Due to the Law of Aversion, this Aspect is typically infeasible to be used for the outright manipulation, creation, or destruction of Life.

## Growth

The Aspect of **Growth** gives one the ability to manipulate the _progression_ of things. In a sense, Growth is the domain over chronology. Applications of Growth are most often applied to medicine, in order to expedite the healing process.

## Shape

The Aspect of **Shape** gives one the domain over the _shapes_ of living creatures. Due to the Law of Aversion, applying to this Aspect is nearly impossible, except on the willing, or on oneself.

## Will

The Aspect of **Will** gives one the domain over the _volition_ of living creatures. This aspect, at a most fundamental level, manipulates the willpower of living creatures, bending them to the Acronist's wishes. In most regions of Naos, this Aspect is highly frowned upon, as it is attached to the Primal Soul.

## Emotion

The Aspect of **Emotion** gives the domain over the _emotions_ of living creatures, controlling their amplitude and shape.


# The Dread

The **Dread** are the manifestations of [[Altrement|The Dark Between]]. They are seven entities that each represent an aspect of humans' fear of the end of all things, which is what the Dark is. They were manifested from [[The End of All Things]], when the [[Dominion]] created the [[Worldsphere|Worldspheres]] to defy the end of the Universe. They are the embodiment of the existential dread that all humans fear—of the non-existence that lies at the end of life, and furthermore at the end of the Universe, when all energy and matter has returned to nothing.

## The Dark

The Dread, for most of their existence, are amorphous, completely residing in the formless void of the Dark Between. It is only when they are pulled into a physical universe through an [[Entanglement]] that they take form, thought, and sentience.

## The Dreads

### The Terror
[[The Terror]] is the first of the Dread, representing the human emotion of despair and overwhelming sense of futility felt when realizing the end of all things.

### The Empty
[[The Empty]] is the representation of the void, the nothingness that awaits the end of all things.

### The Patient
[[The Patient]] is the representation that the end will come no matter what, it is inevitable, and all one must do is wait for it.

### The Unravelled
[[Etnu|The Unravelled]], also known as *Etnu*, is the embodiment of *entropy* and equilibrium. The End will bring about a void with no gradient or change.

### The Spiral
[[The Spiral]] is the chaos. It is the disorder and the endless breaking down of patterns into smaller and smaller pieces, the fractal nature of the universe dissolving until nothing whole is left.

### The Darkness
[[The Darkness]], also known as *Videnis*, is the literal representation of the absence of light and the shroud of eternal darkness that comes with the End.

### Oblivion
[[Oblivion]] is the last and final Dread, the representation of the erasure of everything from existence: thought, knowledge, life, matter, light, everything. The existential simulacrum of everything the Dread as a whole embody.

Come up with a detailed description and character sheet for Etnu using the boss stats pattern. 

# Etnu - The Unravelled

## Description
Etnu is a towering, skeletal creature made of black metal and swirling black smoke. Its form is constantly shifting and changing, as if it is in a perpetual state of flux. Red eyes gleam in the darkness, giving off an ominous glow. The smoke that surrounds Etnu seems to be alive, twisting and writhing as if searching for prey. It emits an aura of raw force, drawing anyone near it close to the edge of a bottomless pit.

Etnu's presence is both awe-inspiring and terrifying, instilling a sense of dread in those who encounter it. Its origins are shrouded in mystery, but it claims to have once been called Etnu by some.

## Boss Trait: The Unravelled

### Giant Entity:
- 12: Entropic Aura
- 8: Shifting Form
- 12: Devour Essence
- 8: Warp Reality
- 10: Unyielding Presence

### SFX:
- _Entropic Surge_: Spend a PP to step up Devour Essence by one and keep up to three additional effect dice. Additional effect dice may only be used to create complications on the scene.
- _Unfathomable Existence_: When attacked by non-luminous magic or abilities, Etnu may choose to negate the attack's effect and step up Unyielding Presence by one.

## Abilities

### Devour Essence:
Etnu has the ability to consume the essence or life force of living creatures or objects. This allows it to grow stronger as it absorbs more energy.

### Warp Reality:
Etnu can warp reality around itself, altering the fabric of space and time in its immediate vicinity. This allows it to manipulate its surroundings and create distortions that disorient or trap its opponents.

### Shifting Form:
Etnu's form is in a constant state of flux, allowing it to change its shape and size at will. This makes it difficult to predict or target, as it can reshape itself to avoid attacks or take on different forms for various purposes.

## Signature Asset: Darksteel Blade

Etnu possesses a darksteel blade that radiates an aura of darkness. The blade is incredibly sharp and infused with Etnu's own entropic energy, making it capable of cutting through almost anything. It is a powerful weapon that Etnu wields with deadly precision.

## Weaknesses

### Luminous Magic:
Due to Etnu's connection with the Dark Between, it is especially vulnerable to attacks or abilities fueled by luminous magic. The radiant energy of luminous magic can weaken its form and disrupt its entropic powers.

### Collective Conviction:
If a group of individuals can come together and manifest a strong collective conviction against Etnu, they may be able to temporarily weaken its powers and create an opportunity to defeat or bind it.

## Backlash

When Etnu manifests its powers in a physical universe, it risks attracting the attention of other entities from the Dark Between. These entities may view Etnu as a threat or rival and attempt to destroy or consume it. This constant threat creates a perpetual state of danger for Etnu, making any interaction with mortal beings potentially risky.'

## Guide for playing Etnu as the Game Master

Playing Etnu as the Game Master requires a careful balance of power and mystery. Etnu should be portrayed as an enigmatic and powerful being, capable of incredible feats but also harboring weaknesses and vulnerabilities. Here are some guidelines for playing Etnu:

- **Ominous Presence**: Etnu should loom over the players, both figuratively and literally. Its mere presence should inspire fear and awe in the characters, making them think twice before attempting to confront or challenge it directly.

- **Mysterious Origins**: Keep Etnu's origins shrouded in mystery. Drop hints and clues throughout the campaign that slowly reveal its true nature, but leave enough ambiguity to keep players guessing. The unknown aspects of Etnu's backstory will add to its allure and make encounters with it more suspenseful.

- **Devastating Powers**: When Etnu unleashes its powers, it should have a profound impact on the world around it. Use the boss traits and abilities to create dramatic and destructive effects that challenge the players and push their limits.

- **Unpredictability**: Etnu's shifting form and entropic nature make it difficult to predict its actions. Incorporate this unpredictability into your descriptions of how it moves, attacks, or defends itself. This will keep players on their toes and force them to constantly adapt their strategies.

- **Vulnerable Moments**: While Etnu is a formidable opponent, there should be moments when its weaknesses are exposed or when players have an opportunity to exploit its vulnerabilities. These moments could come during critical story events or through clever planning by the characters.

- **Consequence of Interaction**: Remind your players that any interaction with Etnu carries risks. Its presence in the physical universe could attract other beings from the Dark Between, setting in motion dangerous consequences beyond just a direct confrontation with Etnu.

Remember that playing as Etnu is not about defeating the players, but about creating a tense and thrilling experience. Use Etnu as a catalyst for character development, as an enigmatic force that challenges their beliefs and pushes them to confront their deepest fears.

## The Dark Between Creature Stats

Come up with boss stats and a description for a more minor creature from the Dark Between. A minion of the Dread.



# Minor Creature - Shadow Stalker

## Description
The Shadow Stalker is a creature born from the darkness of the Dark Between. It is a small, shadowy figure that moves with unnatural speed and agility. Its form is constantly shifting and warping, making it difficult to get a clear look at it. Red eyes gleam from within the darkness, giving off an eerie glow.

The Shadow Stalker is a relentless hunter, always on the prowl for its next victim. It has the ability to blend into shadows and disappear from sight, making it an elusive and deadly adversary.

## Creature Trait: Darkness Incarnate

### Shadowy Form:
- 6: Stealth
- 8: Shape Shifting
- 6: Enhanced Agility
- 4: Darkness Manipulation

### SFX:
- _Vanishing Act_: Spend a PP to step up Stealth by one and keep up to two additional effect dice. Additional effect dice may only be used to create complications on the scene.
- _Shadow Step_: When attacked by non-luminous magic or abilities, the Shadow Stalker may choose to negate the attack's effect and step up Stealth by one.

## Abilities

### Shape Shifting:
The Shadow Stalker can change its form at will, allowing it to adapt to different situations or blend into its surroundings. This makes it difficult for opponents to track or target.

### Darkness Manipulation:
The Shadow Stalker has control over shadows and darkness, able to manipulate them to its advantage. It can create illusions, blind opponents, or even use shadows as weapons.

## Signature Asset: Cloak of Shadows

The Shadow Stalker possesses a cloak made of pure darkness that grants it enhanced stealth abilities. The cloak allows it to move unseen in shadows and grants it heightened agility when navigating dark environments.

## Weaknesses

### Luminous Magic:
Like all creatures born from the Dark Between, the Shadow Stalker is vulnerable to attacks or abilities fueled by luminous magic. The radiant energy of luminous magic can weaken its form and disrupt its abilities.

### Dispersed Shadows:
While the Shadow Stalker is resistant to physical attacks, it is susceptible to attacks that disperse or manipulate shadows. Disturbing the very essence of darkness can force the creature out of its hiding spots and make it more vulnerable.

## Backlash

When the Shadow Stalker is defeated or destroyed, its essence returns to the Dark Between. However, there is always a risk that other creatures from the Dark Between will be drawn to the disturbance caused by its defeat. These creatures may seek revenge or attempt to fill the void left by the fallen Shadow Stalker.

## Guide for using Shadow Stalkers as Game Master

Shadow Stalkers are versatile creatures that can be used in a variety of ways to challenge your players. Here are some guidelines for using them effectively:

- **Stealthy Ambushes**: Use the Shadow Stalker's stealth abilities to set up surprise encounters with your players. Have them suddenly appear from darkness, catching the characters off guard and forcing them into tense combat situations.

- **Elusive Foes**: Make use of the Shadow Stalker's shape-shifting and agility to create encounters where players must track and outmaneuver their foe. The creature's ability to blend into shadows should provide opportunities for creative problem-solving.

- **Illusions of Fear**: Utilize the darkness manipulation abilities of Shadow Stalkers to create illusions that play on your players' fears and weaknesses. These illusions can distract or disorient characters, making combat more challenging.

- **Relentless Pursuit**: Instill a sense of urgency by having Shadow Stalkers relentlessly chase after your players throughout a campaign or scenario. Their ability to disappear into shadows means they can strike unexpectedly at any time.

- **Vulnerable Moments**: Provide moments when players have a chance to exploit the Shadow Stalker's vulnerabilities. This could be through clever use of light-based abilities or by manipulating the environment to disperse shadows.

Remember to balance the encounters with Shadow Stalkers according to your players' abilities and levels. These creatures should provide a challenge, but not overwhelm the characters completely. Use their abilities strategically to create tension and excitement in your game sessions.
