# The Exchange
In order for an Acronist to leverage a [[Primal Spirits|Primal Spirit]] in their [[Conviction|Convictions]], they must complete [[The Exchange]]. The Exchange takes many forms, depending on both the particular Spirit involved and the specific cultural practices of the Acronist. In some cultures, such as the in [[Kingdom of Lashana]], their worship of the [[Primal Spirit of Fire|Primal Fire]] gave their most devout worshippers control over the Aspects of Fire.

Typically, exchanges made with any of the Spirits are more simple, either involving a Summoning and capture of part of the Primal Spirit, or consistent worship of a particular Spirit. In rare cases, a Primal Spirit may reach into the physical realm and *choose* a Scion, creating a pact with a mortal at birth, as is the case with [[Elemental Scion|Elemental Scions]] and [[Shifter|Shifters]].

The exception, however, is the Primal Soul. The Primal Soul, considered more sentient and *aware* than the other Spirits, often requires a **Bargain** to be struck with the Acronist. Since the [[Primal Spirits#Corruption of the Primal Soul|Corruption of the Primal Soul]], exchanges with the Primal Soul are mostly frowned upon, and in some places, illegal.
