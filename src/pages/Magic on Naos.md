title: Magic on Naos
---

In Naos, the primary source of Magic is [[The Luminary]], contained within a great celestial body that orbits the planet. All sentient creatures on Naos are connected to the Luminary through an invisible strand known as a [[Thread]], or Tether. With enough Magical power, and the right know-how, the Thread can be [[severed]].

## Luminous Magic
In Naos, all living creatures with a [[Thread]] have the ability to do [[Luminous Magic]], but it is not easy. The Thread gives creatures a connection to [[The Luminary]], which is the source of all life on Naos. Creating Magic is the act of traversing one’s soul across the tether and interfacing with the Luminary. In order to create Magical effects, one must provide the Luminary with a [[Conviction]].

## Losing Magic
Given enough power/technique, creatures can have their [[Thread]] severed, leaving them unable to use the [[The Luminary]] for Magic, becoming a [[Fade|fade]]. The Faded are also unaffected by [[Luminous Magic]].

## Other Forms of Magic
### Lightless
While the Luminary is the primary source of Magic on Naos, there are two other forms that Magic can take. One is still technically [[Luminous Magic]]—Magics created by [[Lightless]] through the Corrupt [[Primal Spirit of Soul|Primal Soul]].

### The Altrement
The last source of Magic on Naos is [[Altrement]], otherwise known as The Dark Between. This form of Magic is extraordinarily rare and often makes the anyone who comes into contact with it go insane. The most common and stable form of the Altrement comes in the form of pacts with beings from the Dark Between that have been able to manifest in physical form and stabilize the chaos coming from the Altrement.
