title: Cornerstone
---

The **Cornerstone** is the base state of reality as defined and governed by [[The Luminary]]. Any [[Conviction|Convictions]] manifested by [[Acronist|Acronists]] may temporarily *lift* reality from the Cornerstone. Once the Conviction is determined to be a *falsehood* by the Luminary, reality will snap back to the Cornerstone. Depending on the magnitude of the [[Conviction]] and the manner with which it was falsified, [[Backlash]] may occur.
