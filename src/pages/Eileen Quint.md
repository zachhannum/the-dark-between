## Events of Enzo Quint's Dissapearance

Eileen was an instrumental person in the events that followed her father Enzo's disappearance. She found a [[The Sixth Tinwheel]], the proceeded to hire and work alongside [[Corrin Fane]], [[Sulazar Stillwater]], [[Lucian Cullpepper]], and [[Arlo Livingston]] to solve the case.

During the investigation, she, along with [[Lucian Cullpepper]], went to the [[Central Bank of Meripol]] in order to investigate Enzo's accounts, looking for potential clues. While there, the bank was held up by a hired thug named [[Roz Daras]], who seemed to also want access to Enzo's accounts. They thwarted the would-be bank robber, and Eileen gained access to Enzo's deposit box, in which she discovered [[The First Tinwheel]] and papers describing various payments that Enzo was making and receiving. Payments for purchases to a corporation called [[Crimson]], now identified to be a shell for the [[Sonxai]], and the [[Prisma Travel Corporation]], for transport of unknown goods from the town of [[Gris]], as well as payments *from* [[Rikkart Lauten]].

She has kept tabs on her brother, [[Vytas Quint]], and father, [[Ari Quint]], giving them updates on her investigation. She also took care of her brother, who was brought to their house by the [[Protoxy]] [[Emere Renguard]], clearly high on [[Lotus]]. Her brother is the one who gave her the idea to check Enzo's accounts.

She infiltrated a gala hosted by the [[Lauten Family]], together with [[Arlo Livingston]], [[Lucian Cullpepper]], and [[Sulazar Stillwater]] in order to investigate their involvement in her Father's dissapearance. There, she met and talked with various member's of the [[Aljiedum Noble Houses|Noble Houses]], including meeting [[Vera Lauten]] herself.
