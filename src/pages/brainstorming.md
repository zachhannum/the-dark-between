Do Not Look into the
A Dark Between
  
The Dark Between, or the Altrement, represents the true chaos of the world. It's the infinite meaninglessness of the Universe. So much of our time is spent up just trying to understand it, trying and catalog and write our own rules for how it should work. The Between is the infinite space separating everything we know and everything we don't know. It's the creeping unknown just outside the edge of your vision. The everything that the Universe is not. Outside of the fundamental rules of existence is not nothing. It's chaos.

"I've seen the dark between worlds! I've seen the lightless eye that does not watch but sees all! Out in the dark, in the space between everything we know, is madness."

Do you concern yourself with the beating of your heart, or your lungs that take in breath? Much in the same way, the Thread is just another part of you, an accompaniment to your soul. It is simply another part of living, and of dying.

Themes to explore:
- What is Natural? What is Unnatural?
- Is Good or Evil natural? A predisposition?
- What is the Self? We are all just atoms made into a whole, but what makes a person a person?
- Are we above our primal instincts and fears?

Rikkart Lauten was top of his class at the Basentia. By all accounts, he was perhaps one of the best Acronists the university had seen in a very long time. His younger sister, Vera, rode along his coattails, never as talented but always happy to be along for the ride, revelling in her brother's greatness. Rikkart, however, let his hubris be his downfall. He tried to connect with the Primal Spirit Soul, but it backfired on him, allowing an army of corrupt scions to be let loose in the school. In the chaos, his Thread is severed by one of the scions, turning him into a Fade. His sister is there to witness it. Obviously unable to continue his studies, he leaves the school, and mostly vanishes from the public eye. A few years later, he commits suicide, leaving his family in ruin. His family is able to cover it up, and the public assumes he continues to live a quiet, secluded life, which is not uncommon for the Faded. Vera finishes her studies, and as the years pass, she begins to garner a full-fledged hatred of the Basentia Omnia and all it stands for. They betrayed her brother---were negligent in their care and when he was no longer useful to them, they tossed him to the side and let him die. So, when she heard whispers of a professor at the Basentia that had discovered something he shouldn't have, she thought perhaps she could use him and the knowledge as leverage to put the University in a bad light, maybe even right some wrongs. What she discovers, however, takes her down a much darker path.

Things to flesh out:
- The Lauten Estate - they will probably go here at some point to question the family. Obviously Rikkart will not be there
- Perhaps Vera works at the Basentia now? She was trying to change it from within but realizes she no longer can
- Fake-out Rikkart. The family has a Shifter acting as Rikkart to sell the fact that he is still alive and didn't kill himself.
- Vera has a Msanti working for her. Perhaps some clues that lead them to going and trying to track down some Msanti in order to figure something out
- Eventually there will be a clue that will lead them to learning that Rikkart is dead.
- Underground/sewer hideout for Msanti? Could be cool.
- Vera's end goals. She obviously wants to use the Altrement to destroy the Basentia, but how does it work? This will likely be a scenario where she doesn't realize what she has done and there is a "final final" boss that is an eldritch manifestation that the party has to defeat.
- Perhaps students are starting to go missing.
- More tapes that the party can find as breadcrumbs. Work out a way to have Enzo continue recording them.
- The students that they play in the one-shot can be NPCs they question during the campaign
Make a NPC that is from Gris.

Organization within the Argent that hunts down Lightless and brings them to justice.

Cult, Sigils, Symbols, Dark Gods/Demons that are from the [[Altrement]]. [[Vera Lauten]] and [[Enzo Quint]] were studying these cults to understand them and where some of their power came from. Possible tie-ins to party family members? Idols found in ancient texts. 

Sound, a certain melody that people here from the Dark Between

Train to Gris?

People trying to profit off of it? That would be a cool angle.

Someone meticulously collecting blood or some other sample for sacrifices

A vessel capable of holding a whole new world inside of them. 

Enzo was discovering artifacts that suggest worship of ancient beings? Strange cultures from the pre-history of Aljieudum that do not match up with the Primal Spirits. 

Don't forget about reincarnation. That needs to be a big part of religion with the Argent and the Luminary. 

## Plot thread for Vytas Quint
When the party goes to talk with [[Eileen Quint]] at [[The Basentia Omnia|The Basentia]], [[Vytas Quint]] will show up. While he no longer sees his father, he got word that Iris was staying with [[Ari Vochard]]. Vytas wants to know if Enzo is okay, but is also there to ask for more money, as he has been spending most of his at seedy taverns on various debaucheries.


Smoking eyes? Idk could be cool
