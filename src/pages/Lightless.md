# The Lightless

*Foul, despicable creatures. To commit such a willing sin to unmake your soul and bind it to such a odious being is reprehensible. Worse, even than being untethered entirely. To be shackled to the corrupt Soul is to commit the highest of infedelities to the Luminary. It is a mockery of the Faith.*

Lightless are humans who have chosen to forgo their tether to the Luminary and instead bind themselves to the corrupt [[Primal Spirit of Soul|Primal Soul]]. They go by many other names—Karaatmar, Darklings, Demons.

### The Corrupt [[Primal Spirit of Soul|Primal Soul]]
Long ago, the [[Primal Spirit of Soul]] became twisted and defiled, and malformed into a new being. This new Corrupt Soul, still tethered to  [[The Luminary]], grew into a new symbol within the [[The Argent|Argentia]], an emblem of wickedness and all that is unholy within humanity.
  
### Unholy Bond
To many, the Lightless are a living blasphemy against the Luminary. Unlike the [[The Faded|Faded]], who are simply untethered completely—and generally not by choice—the Lightless are untethered from the Luminary and bound to the corrupt soul instead. This pact gives the Lightless inhuman abilities—heightened senses, the ability to read emotions, a longer lifespan, and access to [[Magic on Naos|Magics]] that would otherwise be unreachable to mere humans.
