The **Dread** are the manifestations of [[Altrement|The Dark Between]]. They are seven entities that each represent an aspect of humans' fear of the end of all things, which is what the Dark is. They were manifested from [[The End of All Things]], when the [[Dominion]] created the [[Worldsphere|Worldspheres]] to defy the end of the Universe. They are the embodiment of the existential dread that all humans fearâ€”of the non-existence that lies at the end of life, and furthermore at the end of the Universe, when all energy and matter has returned to nothing.

## The Dark

The Dread, for most of their existence, are amorphous, completely residing in the formless void of the Dark Between. It is only when they are pulled into a physical universe through an [[Entanglement]] that they take form, thought, and sentience.

## The Dreads

### The Terror
[[The Terror]] is the first of the Dread, representing the human emotion of despair and overwhelming sense of futility felt when realizing the end of all things.

### The Empty
[[The Empty]] is the representation of the void, the nothingness that awaits the end of all things.

### The Patient
[[The Patient]] is the representation that the end will come no matter what, it is inevitable, and all one must do is wait for it.

### The Unravelled
[[Etnu|The Unravelled]], also known as *Etnu*, is the embodiment of *entropy* and equilibrium. The End will bring about a void with no gradient or change.

### The Spiral
[[The Spiral]] is the chaos. It is the disorder and the endless breaking down of patterns into smaller and smaller pieces, the fractal nature of the universe dissolving until nothing whole is left.

### The Darkness
[[The Darkness]], also known as *Videnis*, is the literal representation of the absence of light and the shroud of eternal darkness that comes with the End.

### Oblivion
[[Oblivion]] is the last and final Dread, the representation of the erasure of everything from existence: thought, knowledge, life, matter, light, everything. The existential simulacrum of everything the Dread as a whole embody.
