The following is background information on an rpg campaign called The Dark Between. It takes place on a world called Naos.

In Naos, the primary source of Magic is [[The Luminary]], contained within a great celestial moon that orbits the planet. All living creatures on Naos are connected to the Luminary through an unseen, metaphysical strand known as a [[Thread]]. Magic on Naos is more specifically known as [[Luminous Magic]].

Manifesting magical effects with Luminous Magic involves interfacing directly with the Luminary using the Thread and providing the celestial entity with a [[Conviction]].

[[Acronist|Acronists]] are what most magic users on Naos are known as. Since Luminous Magic is based on *belief*, not just that of the individual, but to a greater power extent the collective belief of all of Naos, *religion* has played a significant role in how Luminous Magic, and more specifically, Acronists form successful convictions without incurring [[Backlash]] likely to injure themselves or, more likely, tear a hole in reality. In areas of the world such as [[Aljieudum]], where [[The Argent]] is the most prevalent religion, Acronists garner much of their abilities from the [[Primal Spirits]], gaining specific powers through [[Primal Aspects]] tied to each Spirit.

The Primal Spirits are comprised of six powerful beings, created from the [[The Luminary]]. The six primal spirits are [[Primal Spirit of Air|Air]], [[Primal Spirit of Water|Water]], [[Primal Spirit of Earth|Earth]], [[Primal Spirit of Fire|Fire]], [[Primal Spirit of Bone|Bone]], and [[Primal Spirit of Soul|Soul]].

The types of Primal Acronists are:

- Furybearer
- Stonesinger
- Farseeker
- Vastcaller
- Boneforger
- Soulrender

**Stonesingers** are Acronists who have bonded with the Primal Spirit of Earth. They are granted access to the Aspects of _Memory_, _Material_, and _Gravity_.

**Farseeker**s are Acronists who have bonded with the Primal Spirit of Air. They are granted access to the Aspects of _Gravity_, _Space_, and _Illusion_.

**Boneforger** are Acronists who have bonded with the Primal Spirit of Bone. They are granted access to the Aspects of _Life_, _Growth_, and _Shape_.

**Soulrender** are Acronists who have bonded with the Primal Spirit of Soul. They are granted access to the Aspects of _Shape_, _Will_, and _Emotion_.

Dr. Enzo Quint was a professor at [[The Basentia Omnia|The Basentia]] and a [[Acronist#Stonesingers|Stonesinger]],  well known for his research into the scientific implications of the [[Thread]] and how it relates to the [[The Luminary]].


Fades—or, the Faded—whether willingly or forcibly, have their [[Thread|tether]] to [[Luminous Magic]] severed, rendering them unable to use Magic or be touched by it in any way.

The Msanti, or the Dwellers in the Deep, as they are otherwise known, are humanoid creatures that live in the depths of the ocean. It is said that long ago, they were banished to the sea after an indiscretion with the [[Primal Spirit of Water]].

Enzo Quint went missing after apparently recording six tinwheels regarding new research he had gathered.

A Tinwheel a metal cylinder with recorded sounds engraved in it.

Quint began research into the Dark Between when he inadvertently discovered that a Thread resonating at a certain frequency could access a portion of the Altrement. At first, he did not know what he had discovered. His discovery came about as the result of underground research he was performing on the effects of Threads being severed from living creatures, more specifically the types of energy realized during the process.

Within a year, he had expanded his research to begin to understand what the Altrement was and how it could be harnessed. His studies brought the attention of [[Vera Lauten]]. The Lauten Family began bankrolling Quint’s research–Vera put her brother’s name on the Statements which were hidden carefully at the [[Central Bank of Meripol]] along with Enzo’s lockbox containing the first tape. Once he fully realized the danger the Altrement posed to Naos, he vowed to stop his research entirely, attempting to hide his findings. Vera kidnapped Quint and forced him to continue his analysis of the dark, attempting to find ways to weaponize the Altrement for personal gain.

Twenty years ago, Rikkart Lauten, Vera Lauten's older brother, had his Thread severed in an accident related to a professor at the Basentia, Adam La Cour, convincing him to come on an unsanctioned field trip to an ancient city in which they uncovered The Dark Between.

The Dark Between, or the Altrement, represents the true chaos of the world. It's the infinite meaninglessness of the universe. So much of our time is spent up just trying to understand it, trying and catalog and write our own rules for how it should work. 

The Between is the infinite space separating everything we know and everything we don't know. It's the creeping unknown just outside the edge of your vision. The everything that the Universe is not. Outside of the fundamental rules of existence is not nothing. It's chaos.

The Altrement is the space between Universes—a realm outside of any physical or metaphysical.

The **Dread** are the manifestations of [[Altrement|The Dark Between]]. They are seven entities that each represent an aspect of humans' fear of the end of all things, which is what the Dark is. They were manifested from [[The End of All Things]], when the [[Dominion]] created the [[Worldsphere|Worldspheres]] to defy the end of the Universe. They are the embodiment of the existential dread that all humans fear—of the non-existence that lies at the end of life, and furthermore at the end of the Universe, when all energy and matter has returned to nothing.

### The Terror
[[The Terror]] is the first of the Dread, representing the human emotion of despair and overwhelming sense of futility felt when realizing the end of all things.

### The Empty
[[The Empty]] is the representation of the void, the nothingness that awaits the end of all things.

### The Patient
[[The Patient]] is the representation that the end will come no matter what, it is inevitable, and all one must do is wait for it.

### The Unravelled
[[Etnu|The Unravelled]], also known as *Etnu*, is the embodiment of *entropy* and equilibrium. The End will bring about a void with no gradient or change.

### The Spiral
[[The Spiral]] is the chaos. It is the disorder and the endless breaking down of patterns into smaller and smaller pieces, the fractal nature of the universe dissolving until nothing whole is left.

### The Darkness
[[The Darkness]], also known as *Videnis*, is the literal representation of the absence of light and the shroud of eternal darkness that comes with the End.

### Oblivion
[[Oblivion]] is the last and final Dread, the representation of the erasure of everything from existence: thought, knowledge, life, matter, light, everything. The existential simulacrum of everything the Dread as a whole embody.

Lucian Cullpepper, Eileen Quint (Enzo Quint's daughter), Arlo Livingston, and Sulazar Stillwater are 4 individuals attempting to find Enzo and figure out what is going on.

Lucian *"Luci"* Cullpepper is a [[Acronist#Stonesingers|Stonesinger]] and professor at the [[The Basentia Omnia|The Basentia]], teaching [[Edification]]. He was close colleagues with [[Enzo Quint]] before his dissapearance.

Eileen Quint is the daughter of [[Enzo Quint]] and and a student at [[The Basentia Omnia|The Basentia]] studying to be a [[Acronist#Boneforger]]. At the Basentia, her primary fields of study have been archeology and cartography.

Arlo Livingston is a student at [[The Basentia Omnia|The Basentia]] studying to be an [[Acronist#Farseeker|Farseeker]]. He seems to have connections to a man named [[Jax]] that has ties to the criminal underground, and has done jobs for the man. 

Sulazar Stillwater** is a [[Fade|Fade]], currently employed as a diver working odd jobs in [[Meripol]], mainly for the [[Deep Dwellers|Msanti]] in the [[Bathysward]].

Brainstorm a detailed outline for Vera's master plans on utilizing the Dark Between to take revenge on the Basentia for her brother.

Vera Lauten's master plan to utilize the Dark Between to take revenge on the Basentia for her brother's death involves weaponizing the Dread, specifically The Unravelled, The Spiral, and The Darkness.

She intends to use Enzo Quint's research on the Dark Between to create a device that can harness the power of the Dread and unleash it on the Basentia. The device would be powered by a Thread resonating at a specific frequency, which would allow it to access the Altrement and draw power from it.

To create this device, Vera needs Enzo Quint to continue his research into the Dark Between. She has kidnapped him and is forcing him to work for her. Enzo is reluctant to continue his research, having realized the danger that the Altrement poses to Naos. However, Vera has threatened his daughter Eileen's life if he does not comply.

Vera's plan involves using Arlo Livingston's connections with Jax to acquire materials and resources necessary for creating the device. Jax is a known smuggler and black market dealer who can provide them with rare materials and components.

Once they have all the necessary components, they will assemble the device in secret at a remote location outside of Meripol. They will then bring it to Meripol under cover of night and use it to unleash the power of the Dread on the Basentia.

Vera believes that by unleashing chaos and destruction on the Basentia, she will not only avenge her brother but also establish herself as a powerful force in Naos. She plans to use this newfound power to further her own interests and gain control over key institutions in Naos, including The Basentia Omnia.

However, she underestimates the power of the Dread and how unpredictable they can be. If she goes through with her plan, she risks not only destroying herself but also unleashing an even greater threat onto Naos.
