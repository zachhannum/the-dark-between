Jurrin Tuls was a Mechanical Engineer that was hired by [[Enzo Quint]] during their experiments in the [[Bathyslab]]. 

He willingly volunteered to take part in one of the experiments, during which Jurrin's [[Thread]] was severed, creating an [[Entanglement]], allowing for [[Etnu]] and [[Videnis]] to emerge from [[Altrement|The Dark Between]], destroying much of the lab in the process.
