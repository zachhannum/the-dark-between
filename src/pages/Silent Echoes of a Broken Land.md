Summary of Chapter 1:

Rook as they creep through the shadows of Ledane, looking for potential marks to steal from. He comes across a mysterious stranger that appears to be wearing the remnants of noble clothing. They appear to be searching for something. Rook sees the opportunity and attempts to steal from them, but they are more than meets the eye. The Stranger, Evelyn, catches Rook and puts a dagger to their throat. She is just about to kill Rook when a wraith comes around the corner, smelling their mortality. The wraith comes for them, and Evelyn doesn't even know what it is as she is knew to the city. Rook yells for them to run, and helps her escape. It is revealed that Evelyn is new to the city, and is looking for someone. She tries to get Rook to help her.

Chapter 1:

Rook had learned to trust the silence. In the desolate ruins of what was once Ledane, where shadows clung to broken walls and despair lingered in every crevice, silence was his ally. The world had fallen silent—no birdsong, no laughter, only haunting echoes.

As the dim light of dawn cast elongated shadows across the decaying structures, Rook emerged from the safety of his hidden alcove. His charcoal eyes, perpetually watchful, scanned the desolation, seeking any signs of danger. A tattered cloak draped over his lean frame, concealing his wiry build, while a hood shrouded his face, a mask against prying eyes.

He stepped gingerly over crumbling stones and ventured into the main street, once bustling with life, now reduced to a graveyard of memories. His boots whispered against the cobblestones, their soles worn thin from countless treacherous journeys. Each step was a reminder of the fragile line between survival and oblivion.

Rook's keen senses caught the faint sound of distant footsteps, the echo of a lone traveler in this forsaken wasteland. Intrigue flickered in his eyes as he quickened his pace, slipping between the remnants of what were once grand houses. His nimble fingers grazed the hilt of his trusty dagger, a reminder of his constant companion.

Around a corner, he spotted a figure, clad in tattered rags, moving with a cautious grace. The stranger, head held low, seemed burdened by invisible weights, their every step fraught with weariness. Rook's curiosity piqued, urging him forward to unravel the enigma before him.

Closing the distance, Rook stepped into a narrow alley, his footsteps muffled by years of accumulated debris. He leaned against a moss-covered wall, blending into the shadows as he observed the stranger. A soft sigh escaped his lips, an echo of the pain that had forged his hardened soul.

The stranger, oblivious to Rook's presence, paused near an abandoned well, their gaze fixated on a fragment of shattered glass strewn amidst the rubble. With trembling hands, they knelt and picked up the shard, staring into its jagged reflection.

Rook watched from the shadows, curious about the stranger's intentions. They seemed lost in thought, as if the broken piece of glass held some significance to them.

Upon closer inspection, Rook realized that the tattered rags the stranger wore were the remnants of noble clothing. A potential mark, then. Perhaps today would not be a waste after all, if the stranger had something of value that Rook could steal.

Rook crept closer, his hand inching towards his dagger, ready to strike. But just as he was about to pounce, the stranger turned their head and caught sight of him.

Startled, Rook froze in place as the stranger rose to their feet. In one fluid motion, they drew a dagger from their belt and pressed it against Rook's throat.

"You picked the wrong person to rob," the stranger said with a cold edge in their voice. "Who are you?"

Rook's mind raced as he tried to come up with a plausible answer. He couldn't reveal his true identity as a thief, not when faced with someone who seemed capable of killing him without batting an eye.

"I'm just passing through," he said, trying to keep his tone neutral.

The stranger's eyes narrowed, searching for any signs of deception. "And what do you want?"

"Nothing from you," Rook replied hastily. "I was just... curious."

The stranger chuckled, a mirthless sound that sent shivers down Rook's spine. "Curious? In this place? You must be either brave or foolish. Or both."

They lowered their dagger and stepped back, giving Rook some breathing room. Rook took the opportunity to slip away, but before he could make his escape, an unearthly wail echoed through the alleyway.

Both Rook and the stranger froze in place as a wraith materialized from the shadows, its form shifting and twisting like smoke in the wind. Its eyes glowed with an otherworldly hunger as it let out another piercing scream.

"What... what is that?" The stranger stammered, her grip on her dagger tightening.

"A wraith," Rook replied grimly. He had encountered them before in this broken land—creatures born of despair and malice that hungered for mortal souls.

The wraith lunged at them with unnatural speed, its claws reaching for their throats. Rook acted on instinct, grabbing the stranger's arm and pulling her towards him as he dodged the wraith's attack.

"Run!" Rook yelled, pushing her towards the alleyway's exit. "I'll hold it off!"

With adrenaline coursing through his veins, Rook drew his dagger and faced the wraith head-on. He knew he had seconds, mere heartbeats, to distract the creature and give the stranger a chance to escape.

The wraith lunged again, its spectral form barely visible against the backdrop of decay. Rook dodged its claws with practiced precision, but he could feel its malevolent presence closing in on him. He knew he couldn't hold it off for long.

The stranger hesitated for a moment, torn between fleeing to safety and staying to help Rook. But as another wail echoed through the alleyway, she made her decision. With determination etched across her face, she sprinted towards the exit.

Rook watched her disappear into the gloom before turning his attention back to the wraith. He lunged forward, slashing at its insubstantial form with all his might. Though his blade passed through it without resistance, he hoped to buy enough time for the stranger to escape unharmed.

But the wraith was relentless. It swirled around him like a ghostly cyclone, its icy breath chilling him to the bone. Rook's movements became more desperate as he fought against an enemy that could not be defeated by conventional means.

A surge of desperation coursed through him as he realized his fate was sealed. The wraith's claws closed in on him, ripping through his cloak and slicing across his arm. Pain shot through his body, but he refused to give up.

Summoning every ounce of strength left within him, Rook unleashed a flurry of attacks on the wraith's ethereal form. His strikes grew wild and erratic as exhaustion threatened to overwhelm him. But just as despair threatened to consume him whole, a bolt of lightning crackled through the air.

The stranger had returned—She stood at the entrance of the alleyway with her hands outstretched, a wellspring of raw power emanating from her. Her eyes blazed with an ancient fury as she unleashed the full force of her sorcery upon the wraith.



The wraith shrieked in agony as the lightning coursed through its spectral form, tearing it apart piece by piece. Rook stumbled back, his breath ragged and body battered, as he watched the stranger's power obliterate the creature that had threatened to claim his life.

With a final burst of energy, the wraith dissipated into nothingness, leaving behind only a faint echo of its presence. The alleyway fell silent once more, the only sound the raspy gasps of Rook and the stranger as they struggled to catch their breath.

Rook looked at the stranger with newfound respect. "Who are you?" he asked, his voice filled with awe and curiosity.

The stranger offered him a weary smile. "My name is Evelyn," she said. "And I'm looking for someone."

Rook's curiosity was piqued once again. "Someone? In this broken land?"

Evelyn nodded solemnly. "Yes. Someone important to me."
