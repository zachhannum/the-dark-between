**Roz Daras** was a [[Acronist#Furybearers|Furybearer]] who held up the [[Central Bank of Meripol]].

## Robbing the Central Bank of Meripol

Daras, with two other criminals, held members and guests of the Central Bank of Meripol in order to break into [[Enzo Quint|Enzo Quint's]] lockbox. It is currently unknown at this time if Daras was acting of his own accord, or if he was hired by an unknown party.

In the heist, Daras carried a weapon, a gun powered by his own [[Primal Aspects#Energy|Energy]].

He was eventually thwarted by [[Lucian Cullpepper]], [[Eileen Quint]], and [[Sulazar Stillwater]], bashed over the head by a piece of rebar by Sulazar Stillwater. After, Daras was taken into custody by the [[Vigil]].
