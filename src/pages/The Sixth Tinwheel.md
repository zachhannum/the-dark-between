## Transcript

*A tinwheel recorder is pressed, and we hear quiet lo-fi background static. A chair creaks as Dr. Enzo Quint leans back.*

**Enzo**
 (sighs)
 Audio log of Dr. Enzo Quint, professor and researcher at the Basentia. This is my sixth recording thus far about the subject. I regret to inform that it may well be my last. If you are listening to this right now, then... Well I'm quite possibly dead. I don't have much time, and if they find out about—
 
 *[Enzo takes a breath to compose himself]* 

 I'm sorry, I'm getting ahead of myself.  My research at the Basentia has always been about the Luminary. I've tried to quantify and study what we know as the Thread, and all things related to it. The sort of research that has always been looked upon favorably by the Protoxies. But... I've discovered something else. Something entirely apart from the Luminary. Over the past few months I have attempted to quantify and understand this phenomenon, but I can no longer continue my research. I have hidden the rest of my tapes in secure locations and will be ceasing any further—

*Enzo is interrupted mid-speech by a knock at the door. There is a pause, then another knock.*

**Enzo**
(irritably)
Yes, come in.

*A door creaks open, followed by a few footsteps as Eileen steps into the room.*

**Enzo**
(irritably)
Eileen, I've told you not to bother me while I'm working. 

**Eileen**
(timid)
I'm sorry, En, I know. I said wouldn't, but... there's someone here to see you.


**Enzo**
Who?

**Eileen**
Um, well I don't know their name. But... En, it's one of the *Altuer*.

*[For a moment, Enzo is silent]*

**Enzo**
(restrained)
One of the Msanti is downstairs right now?

*[pause]*

Go to your room. Don't come out until I come to get you. And if I don't come to get you, go to the Basentia. Ari will look after you while I'm away.

**Eileen**
(panic creeping in to her voice)
En, what are you talking about? I don't understand—

**Enzo**
Eileen, please. Go.

*Eileen leaves, and the door closes. A chair scrapes and Enzo stands. He walks out of the room and shuts the door behind him and locks it. Floorboards creak as he makes his way downstairs.*

*Indistinct conversation, intelligible, begins. Although no words can be made out, one voice becomes increasingly pleading. The conversation is interrupted with a boom as Enzo is thrown against the wall, knocked unconcious.*

*Heavy creaking begins as something climbs the steps. They struggle with the door, eventually breaking through. Heavy footfalls approach the recording device and a pneumatic system can be heard—the rythmic pressurizing and depressurizing of the Msanti's suit.*

*The tinwheel recorder clicks off.*
