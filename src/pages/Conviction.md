# Conviction

A Conviction is a statement of belief to the Luminary, something that is not true but that the [[Acronist]] firmly believes is true. When [[Luminous Magic]] is cast on Naos, the wielder must form a Conviction strong enough to convince [[The Luminary]] that whatever they believe is reality, thus manifesting their belief in the physical world.

The difficulty of manifesting a successful Conviction is directly proportional to the number of things that would need to change about reality in order to avoid contradictions. If an Acronist pushes a Conviction too hard, and the contradictions are too severe, there is a risk of *Thread Fatigue*, leaving the Acronist unable to form Convictions until they have mentally recovered. This can leave the user in a state of both physical and mental exhaustion for a period of time.

If a Conviction is strong enough, it can become a [[Fixed Truth]].
