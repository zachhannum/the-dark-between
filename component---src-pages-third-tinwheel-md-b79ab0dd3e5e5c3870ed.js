It has been some time since I recorded one of these. To whomever may eventually listen to this, I have much to catch you up on. This is my third such recording detailing my findings of Thread severance and how it relates to strange phenomenon that have been observed throughout the centuries, by the cult known as the Church of Aphothis, and again by a professor La Cour and his students some twenty years ago. After my trip to Mehnateruna to see the ruins of the city for myself, I realized that whatever secrets that city held had since been destroyed. Much to my disappointment.

A bit mad, perhaps, but who wouldn't be, who had seen what he had seen? The Lightless Eye and Lauten were surprisingly open about their knowledge. They have developed a way to manipulate one's thread, bringing it into the physical realm through some kind of psychoactive drug. They call it Lotus. The severing of a Thread in this state releases a special kind of... energy. With the proper equipment, this energy can be used to open a... gateway, of sorts. To what, I am still unclear. I have been unable to get clear answers from the Eye regarding this. Lauten calls it the Dark Between.
