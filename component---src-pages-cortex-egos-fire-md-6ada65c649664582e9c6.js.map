An overwhelming number of towers and spires of varying heights loom over the deep canyons between each plateau. Large Aerostats float high above the city, entering and exiting the massive Prismagates that sit atop the tallest building on the center plateau. We eventually come to a set of buildings on the eastern plateau, built from dark, smooth stone. The Basentia Omnia, a storied University that houses and trains some of the most talented Acronists in all of Selar. Wide, well-kept lawns with exquisite topiaries separate each of the buildings. Paved walking paths twist and turn around the campus, and students dressed in long coats and furs hustle briskly to their classes, eager for the semester to end and the Illuminaris, a winter festival celebrated in Aljiedum, to begin. We make our way to one of the building’s tall spires, through a stained window and into a small but comfortable office, where we find four students sitting across from the desk of Professor Kalia Samira.
