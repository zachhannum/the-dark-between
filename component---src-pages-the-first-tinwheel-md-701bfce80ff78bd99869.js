The record states that they inhabited the know ruined city of Mehnateruna, once the jewel of the Kingdom of Lashana some three hundred years earlier. What I find so curious is that their belief system that has been described in this document does not seem to align with the proto-Argent idealogies that began to become popular at the time. Many of the Kingdoms in Northern Selar at this time began to merge their beliefs into the Pentarian structure we see in modern Argentia today. "),(0,r.kt)("p",null,"But...
