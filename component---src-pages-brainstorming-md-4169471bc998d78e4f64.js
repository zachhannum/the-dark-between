By all accounts, he was perhaps one of the best Acronists the university had seen in a very long time. His younger sister, Vera, rode along his coattails, never as talented but always happy to be along for the ride, revelling in her brother's greatness. Rikkart, however, let his hubris be his downfall. He tried to connect with the Primal Spirit Soul, but it backfired on him, allowing an army of corrupt scions to be let loose in the school. In the chaos, his Thread is severed by one of the scions, turning him into a Fade. His sister is there to witness it. Obviously unable to continue his studies, he leaves the school, and mostly vanishes from the public eye. A few years later, he commits suicide, leaving his family in ruin. His family is able to cover it up, and the public assumes he continues to live a quiet, secluded life, which is not uncommon for the Faded. Vera finishes her studies, and as the years pass, she begins to garner a full-fledged hatred of the Basentia Omnia and all it stands for. They betrayed her brother---were negligent in their care and when he was no longer useful to them, they tossed him to the side and let him die. So, when she heard whispers of a professor at the Basentia that had discovered something he shouldn't have, she thought perhaps she could use him and the knowledge as leverage to put the University in a bad light, maybe even right some wrongs.
